# Meeting with Jan

## Comments during reading

- same experiment (CiviCon 2), but with continuous choice, too? (at which level and progression do you want to tax?)
- lacking priors is common concern
- I am interested in the structure, dimensionality

- maybe part time job?
- think about the political-VWL interest in the experiment with random returns and the benefits of redistribution
- read the paper written by Fabian and Jan

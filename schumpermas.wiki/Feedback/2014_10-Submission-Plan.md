## Submission Plan Meeting

*Date: 2014-10-02*

*Attending: Martin Nonhoff, Maximilian Held*


### Minutes

- **SES data** has not been gathered so far, for time and privacy reasons; Nonhoff urges that it be gathered soon in a simple form. Data can only be used in the aggregate for privacy reasons.
- In light of the little remaining time until planned submission, Max should always plan in terms of **chapters to be submitted**, and always be working on/towards a chapter, no other intermediary or cross-cutting texts. Similarly, other events and/or presentations will be cut as far as possible.
- Max will submit a **table of contents** including deadlines and content for individual dissertation chapters by Oct 6.
- There needs to be an updated abstract or something, establishing the connection again between **methods, results and research questions**


*Later that day, with Olaf Groh-Samberg*

- Max *should* present preliminary results at the **Doctoral Colloquium** in the Fall, but with minimal preparation for the presentation. Just work in progress.
- A meeting with OGS has been scheduled.


### Dissertation Structure, Deadlines

*this structure will not be updated; to sort by deadline, progress and updates, check https://github.com/maxheld83/schumpermas/milestones instead*

*the subitems of the below list are included as issues.*

1. Introduction [based on introduction]
   - why does any of the following matter?
   - because the *welfare state (or mixed economy)* is based on good taxation, and taxation is in crisis.
   - because *representative/pluralist democracy* faces structural (dealignment) and inherent challenges (public choice); tax is that issue where these problems intersect.
   - these possible crises of democracy and taxation may have a profound effect on *social and political equality*
   - Draft completed by **2014-03-15**
1. Research Question [based on proposal]
   - Explicates *research question* at the intersection of the literature on (subjective understandings of) tax, and (empirical research on) deliberative democracy
   - includes literature review of tax misunderstandings/disagreements and empirical deliberative democracy
   - Why tax is a good *case*; and more than a case.
   - Why deliberation is a good *method*; and more than a method.
   - Draft completed by **2014-01-31**
1. Methods-1 (CiviCon)
   - explicates the *treatment condition*; in this case, the CiviCon Citizen Conference
   - *contextualizes* the CiviCon format within existing literature, formats, conflicts, tradeoffs
   - *documents* structure, experts, sample, etc. of CiviCon
   - *reports* on the validity, reliability of the treatment in deliberative terms, including citizen and moderator feedback.
   - Draft completed by **2014-01-15**
1. Methods-2 (Q-Method)
   - explicates the *data*; in this case, Q-Sorts
   - *contextualizes* Q-methodology within existing literature, alternative formats, tradeoffs
   - *documents* q-sampling (of statements), condition of instruction etc.
   - *argues* how/why q-methodology is a fitting method for the (deliberative + tax) research question
   - Draft completed by **2014-11-07**
1. Results-1 (Factors)
   - reports correlations, factors from pre- and post-sort.
   - *factor interpretation* in substantive terms of tax and the economy.
   - Draft completed by **2014-11-24**
1. Results-2 (Treatment Effect)
   - reports *changes* in factor composition and loadings between pre- and post-sort.
   - *factor interpretation* in terms of deliberative democracy (as per Niemeyer: beliefs, values, preferences)
   - testing (increased) *meta-consensus and intersubjective rationality* (aka consistency)
   - additional *qualitative analyses* of selected, cursorily transcripted discussions from CiviCon-1
   - Draft completed by **2014-12-23**
1. Discussion
   - how do the results relate to the posed research question?
   - what are possible issues of *validity, reliability* (both in terms of the theoretical demands of q, and the theoretical demands of the deliberative "treatment")?
   - how does this add to the literature on the *subjectivity on taxation*? (fka as "misunderstandings")
   - how does this add to the literature on *empirical effects of deliberation*?
   - how does this add to the *canon of q-studies*?
   - Draft completed by **2015-02-28**
1. Conclusion
   - what does this add to the debate on the *crises of the welfare/tax state*?
   - what does this add to the debate on the *crises of pluralist/representative democracy*?
   - Draft completed by **2015-03-31**

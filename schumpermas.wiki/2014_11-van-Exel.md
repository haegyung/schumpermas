# Talk at Jacobs University

26.11.2014, Reimar Lüst Hall, several people present (Olaf, Christopher)

On the number of statements, van Exel advcoates using not soo many (not more than 40)

> the information is between the statements; if you have a lot of statements, there is not a lot of room between the statements
> van Exel

Get the latest paper by van Exel; he did a q-study on different conceptions owe f the good life, including Stiglitz, Nussbaum, OECD, etc. (great!)

Notice that I am a little bit unhappy with the standard for developing statements by van Exel; the "pieces of carpet" analogy is, in a way, much more exacting – and maybe less politicized.

Finding very different people for my study was obviously hard; people were not so interested.

Snowballing might be an interesting idea for the future of CiviCon, too: ask subscribed participants to suggest/invite other participants that they will disagree on the topic with.

I don't have a person or viewpoint that woud be more important to rotate to.

van Exel wants a one-stop-shop for Q, maybe a new PQMethod, *including* online administration; this should be a job for

# Meeting in the morning


## Criteria for number of factors to be extracted

- use nloads > 2, eigenvalue
- use Use Horn's Parallel analysis
- use the van Exel method for correlation


## Rotation & Extraction Method

- judgmental would be nice, but can maybe be done later
- there are a lot of new methods being discussed now, including **principal axis analysis** that I should probably look into


## Before-After Effect

There are several ways to look at the treatment effect, in rough order of adequateness for my study:

1. **compare factor loadings**: look at the dimensionality, and loadings of factors befre and after; this would be the broadest kind of result, ideally that the factor space becomes lower dimensional
2. **pooling** of data (including before and after sorts in *one* dataset for analysis): may show different before/after factors, as well as the change of people
3. **2nd order analysis** (make factors out of factors): will be limited because of max. 8 cases (factors), but would be very interesting: these might be the *misunderstandings*
4. **factors of deltas** compute the delta in score for each item (say, item moves from -5 to 2 for a participant), then compute factors of these movements: this may reveal the "misunderstandings", and/or the kinds of learning processes that have happened.
5. **spiking** of data; place (some of the) "before" factor arrays into the "after" dataset as cases; then do judgmental rotation: this is not a very common method, but may reveal how things have changed from the vantage point of "before".


## Visualization

... is key to make quick sense of the data, especially in the form of factor arrays.

- The color of factors might be somehow scaled/chosen based on the cross-factor correlations.
- Include significance of loading of people on factors in the visualization?


## Other interesting stuff

- Look into qblock method – what the hell is that?
- Look at browns factor index approach; people will assign or be confounded to a factor
- Look into latent class analysis
- get back to christopher cohrs,
- figure out political psychology interests of christopher cohrs
- get back to the q guy from berlin, talk to him
- next q conference is in ancona (?) in the next fall.
- Look at the deadline for the q conference in ancona.
- Get in touch with amanda, former editor of OS, who is now in NZ; job suggests to get in touch if I want to spend some time in NZ.
- Comment on the item complexity.
- Have other people sort the qsort as, say, a hyperliberal or something and then use that as a target rotation.
- look at the status quo; do they like


## Interesting journals

(actually these are low-impact, niches, but still)

- operant subjectivity
- quality and quantity

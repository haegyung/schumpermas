<!-- people talked more about general participation, less about tax stuff
also evident in their presentation and feedback -->

<!-- they felt like they did not have enough time to really decide on the tax
there was also no obvious external pressure; nor was it clear that this would have been legitimate
or maybe, it would have been, because an external stake/pressure is just realistic -->

<!-- the proof of concept worked: people liked this -->

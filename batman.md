you can get a sense of the historical scale when batman flies over the vistas of his megacity, and you can hear the works of society ticking in the throbbing music.
When things have gone awry yet again in dystopian Gotham City, we get a thrill that overcoming this is of our own choosing and doing.
The thing is: things are pretty awry, we need a lot of overcoming and a lot of change. The thing is: society really ticks, history is of our choosing.
To be sure, Batman isn't exactly progressive politics. Even if the Dark Knight now has to consider means, not just ends, he's still up against conveniently essential evil. Off screen, we're not, and God forbid we ever try again to make it seem that way. No one is born to be a Joker. And there's still some of that musky hyper-masculinity lingering around these superheroes with conspicuous features, borderline issues and a forcefully impressable damsell in distress.
We don't need no caped crusader, silent guardian, we don't need no rambo-utilitarian jack bauer. We will continue to meddle in uncertainty, to compromise on dissent and to stop, where our means exceed our ends.
There's something we can save off the screen though: the idea that really, there IS a common good and that it is of our own, collective choosing. It's an unlikely place, but there to find it, but there is that essence of deliberative democracy in the Dark Knight.
This is, of course, the sterile aufgeregtheit in which take inconsequential solace, when real complexity overwhelms and meaning evades us. Melodrama may be the dysfunctional illusion of a generation whose belief in its own efficacy is buried. Big-screen crash/boom/bang and pathos certainly is MY metadone for too much word-processor time.

If ever there was postmodernity, The dark knight may be the ultimate allegory/metaphior. For what it's worth, the Joker, (like the Batman, of course) are a thought experiment, and a melodramatical one at that.
No matter,  I'm still with the schemers.
Why is this so great?
Because there is hope. There is change, There is action.
And why is this wrong?
Because today, we live in a world, where our failure, our drama is clad in mediocrity. In the mediocrity of a poor public policy, an unkind word to a stranger. The mediocrity of a world, incompletely understood - and therefore not even tackled.
Mediocrity, you can't fight in a war. You can't, and you must not make public policy and change a melodrama, or worse: a drama. We've seen where that gets. We've seen that movie before.
And still, postmodern resignation is not the answer.
For that, matter, I'm still with the schemers, Mr. Joker.
There is no Joker. THere is no evil against good.
And still, what fascinates me about this movie?
We need to get back to this emotion, that what we're doing matters. That public policy matters, that the life chances of real people are at stake. That's what political rhetorik needs to do.
more oomphf.
There is this excitement in the Dark Knight. There are flashy explosions, thumbing rhythm, and the general notion that this really matters. A boatload of people may day. A love may turn tragic.
Policy is not to be conducted with gunpowder and barrels full of gasoline, unlike the Joker's business. It's success or failure resides in detail, in complexity, in abstraction. Not the stuff of action cinema, as any student of public policy will attest to.
So, the disconnect serves us well. Never again must policy return to the realms of the primordial, the immediate. We've seen this movie, already. And again, and again, and again.
But still. We must remember last reasons. Why are we doing policy? Not because of the abstractions, not because of the economic models or management paradigms. We care, because these abstractions govern real lives.
We need to reconnect this.
It's not about life and death. And it shouldn't be. For these matters - or matters which we make into them - usually involve body counts.
The world doesn't burn. And it's not lit on fire by some single, conveniently disfigured evil clown.
And yet, we watch it smolder. This world stinks, when the women on Oranienburger Straße find reasons and customers, with intimacy for sale. This world suppresses, when a young person in Neukölln grows up, with little opportunity to fully partake in this affluent society, economically and socially. And injustice rages in this world, covered by the thick smoke of conspicuous consumption on Friedrichstraße, right next to a school which claims to "understand today, and shape tomorrow".
This world doesn't burn. But it smolders, and far too often, we get used to the stench, and we don't even see the glow anymore.
this movie is the sterile aufgeregtheit we don't want, and that is commercial and misleading, in any way Adorno thought.
And yet, we have to find it, the real thing.

It's the crash-boom-bang I love. But there is more.
Wayne: "People are dying, Alfred. What would you have me do?"
Alfred: "Endure, Master Wayne. (...) You can be the outcast. You can make the choice that no one else will face. The right choice. Gotham needs you."
Let me be clear: some of the appeal is the dangerous, poisenous hope for the "right choice", a vaguely disguised patronage.
These are the kinds of choices that we no longer have. If we try to, we get into trouble. This isn't plural, this isn't deliberative.
But there is more.
We have been thoroughly innoculized against this kind of hope for the right choice. And you can never be safe enough.
But there is something else, something we mustn't empty with the bathwater.

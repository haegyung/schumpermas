# Preface {-}

<!-- I used to be a pretty centrist, even right of centrist guy. 
More specifically, I used to be affirmative. 
I believed in the institutions that had really been very kind to me all my life. 
Then I looked into things. 
I though they were just random noise, a few mistakes in an actually more or less functional system. 
Turns out, that's not true.

Not: On the shoulders of giants.
But: I was nurtured in fertile ground, forgiven, inspired, motivated, given chances, pampered.

IN the introduction, write about the sociology of my upbringing, how I go to be who I am. By incredible sheltering and nurturing and (petty bourgeois) privilege. Do something like Gladwell does in "Outliers".
- 1a at Grundschule Barrien
- Jacobs, at a time when private english-speaking universities were still new
- the son of the judge, can always cut corners
- Studienstiftung, SchülerAkademie, Fulbright
- not my accomplishment
- my challenges: ill health, Kettenhemd.
- Bilingual high school.
- think about when I work best (SchülerAkademie).
- outcast, introduced socialized by band camp
- county with one of the largest music schools (KMS DH)
- from one of the richest countries. Must be somewhere in the upper xth percentile of income.

make sure this doesn't sound like I think what I wrote would be absolutely brilliant (it may not be) and therefore require explanation of my brilliance.

I have always gotten third chances. -->

## (Mis)understanding the Fine Print of the Social Contract â€“ The Pluralist and Deliberative Politics of Taxation

### Abstract
I wonder:
why, in the richest of countries, in the most enlightened of times (current day OECD-world), are our welfare states so constrained and inefficient, our democracies so confused and distorted?

I ask:
if a hypothetical, superior political process (deliberative democracy) ruled our polity, would we think better and fairer about the institutions of the mixed economy and would we opt for a hypothetical, superior tax regime (PCT, LVT, NIT)?

And so I test:
if given the possibility to deliberate well-informed, fairly and thoroughly (a deliberative forum), will randomly selected, ordinary voters understand the mixed economy differently (better) and prefer a different tax (PCT, LVT, NIT)?

If, in fact, they do, welfare state research will have a lot more to explain, and deliberative democracy will have shown its stripes.

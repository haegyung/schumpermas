# Introduction {#intro}

<!-- . Introduction [based on introduction] -->
<!--    - why does any of the following matter? -->
<!--    - because the *welfare state (or mixed economy)* is based on good taxation, and taxation is in crisis. -->
<!--    - because *representative/pluralist democracy* faces structural (dealignment) and inherent challenges (public choice); tax is that issue where these problems intersect. -->
<!--    - these possible crises of democracy and taxation may have a profound effect on *social and political equality* -->

<!-- > Why, in the most prosperous of economies, are we plagued by widening inequality, underfunded states and persistent unemployment?  
> Why, in the most enlightened of times, are we thoroughly confused about governing our mixed economies and perilously disaffected with the results our democratic rule produces? 
 
> **What if** there were alternative taxes, which afforded us more attractive tradeoffs between economic efficiency, equity and sustainability or other ends  
> **What if** we *could* agree on such alternative taxes, but *would not*, because we lacked the necessary information or suitable fora, and because our capacity for mutual reason-giving had been diminished by alienating inequality or clouded by special interest? -->

<!-- %Second, my research interest emerges from a sense of utter disconnect between political debate and the abstractions and interests governing the political economy.
%This dis-connect is evident in misleading sloganeering (‘Mehr Netto vom Brutto’, more net out of gross income), widespread superstitions (‘employers [sic!] pay half of social insurance’), bastard Keynesianism (‘consumption is good!’) or redistributive smoke grenades (‘we should tax companies’).
%At a deeper level, I wonder whether pluralist interest and electoral re-presentation can still be reasonably assumed to yield efficient and equitable policies, in an ever more complex world marred by cooperation problems. -->

If world history is still written in tax, as @Schumpeter believed, the people of our democracies, too, must read and speak these codes, to live up to the emancipatory promise of modernity.
If communicative action can heal the disagreement and confusion wrought as modernity differentiated System and Lifeworld, as @Habermas-1984 hopes, in our discourse on tax, too, universally acceptable validity claims instead of money and power must rule to uphold our faith in liberal democracy.
<!-- comment MN dependent on each theorie -->

I here probe into one intersection of legitimate inputs and outputs of the social contract [compare @Scharpf1997]: the discourse *on*, and economics *of* tax.

I ask, how --- if at all --- people under current democratic arrangements think and speak differently about tax, from how they *would* think and speak about it, if they lived under conditions of ideal speech.
<!-- not so much the speech with q any more ... -->
I test, how --- if at all --- people change their thinking and speech about tax, if they participate in a democratic process that is *closer* to the Habermasian ideal?
I hypothesize that --- as a result of *more* ideal speech --- people will prefer different taxes, including a PCT.
<!-- %rather than more, write closer to, more could be misunderstood -->


## Structure of the Dissertation {#structure}

The following chapters follow a fairly conventional structure from theory to methods to results and conclusion, but the *status* of especially the first couple of chapters may unclear to readers.
Out of substantive necessity, the references and disciplines in these first couple of chapters can be quite wide-ranging, though these are merely introductory (for the reader) and remedial (for the participants).
To clarify the role of these chapters, let me first situate them within the remainder of this dissertation.

This project is modeled on a straightforward experimental design, as it is frequently used in clinical studies.
However, because the study deals not with easily measurable biomarkers, but with subtleties of deliberation and the abstractions of text, the design can be hard to recognize.


### Research Design by Analogy

Consider an analogous example to let me guide you through the following chapters:
A doctoral candidate in medicine wants to study how a daily morning exercise affects mindfulness.
In this exercise study, the absence (or presence) of the morning routine is the *independent variable* (IV), the kind and level of mindfulness the *dependent variable*.
Analogously, in the present study, the participation in the CiviCon citizen conference is the *IV*, and subjectivities concerning taxation are the *DV*.[^no-rct]
<!-- TODO might cite some experimental design literature here -->

[^no-rct]: Proper experimental designs are often double-blind *randomly controlled trials* (RCT), but these additional rigors are not possible or deemed unnecessary for the present study on deliberation and taxation.

  - A fully **randomized treatment** is impossible, because participants in a deliberative forum will (and should) always be free to exit the sample.
  Because the universe of participants are all citizens, or even all human beings affected by the policy in question, even a reasonably representative quota sample will be hard to come by.
  Largely because of limited resource, the present study is a self-selected haphazard sample, described in more detail in chapter \@ref(civicon).
<!-- TODO ... is that the right reference? VK: it is.-->
  - A **control group** of non-participating citizens would be possible in the present study, but was not included because of limited resources.
  In any event, there were no expected background events or trends affecting the subjectivities concerning taxation of *both* treatment and control groups, so a control group was deemed dispensable.
  Whatever changes the participating citizens displayed are likely to be a result of the deliberation.
  - A **blind design** is impossible because participants will, by the nature of the treatment, always know whether they are participating in a deliberative forum, or not.
  There should be no *placebo* deliberations, though there may well be those formats worthy of such a label.
<!-- TODO refer to chapter were I diss other formats -->

We need to complicate this simple design only a little bit to bring it close the present study on deliberation and taxation, as shown in table \@ref(tab:commented-toc).

First, let us assume that our M.D. to be presents good reasons to concentrate on a *particular* kind of exercise, say, hatha yoga.
Perhaps, the aspiring doctor argues convincingly that hatha yoga is an especially promising treatment, or that it has been previously understudied, or that really, "exercise" without the kind of body-awareness honed by hatha yoga is a meaningless concept, likely to yield only spurious effects, if any.

So it is with this research on deliberation and taxation.
In chapter \@ref(3-crises) I argue that taxation is a key, yet understudied precondition for a functioning mixed-economy and that to be effective, deliberation needs to engage with highly structured and abstract topics such as tax.

Secondly, suppose that our M.D.-hopeful insists on teaching the participants not just some positions, but also other related practices such covering diet (*mitahara*), body cleansing (*shatkarma*), breathing (*pranayama*) as well as some philosophical background.
At this point, her supervisors get a little anxious and worry where this might all lead.
However, our medical student maintains that concentrating on exercise alone is alien to the tradition and shows how the elements of hatha yoga are neatly intertwined.
She is the first to admit that she is not an expert in philosophy, let alone buddhism, but she is confident that she can provide at least *some* helpful background for participants do understand the broader context.

Analogously, this dissertation also requires some deep background for participants and readers alike.
In chapter \@ref(abstractions), I rehearse a few selected abstractions of taxation and microeconomics, including optimality, incidence, the Haig-Simons equivalence of income, the circular flow of the economy and implications of personal taxation.
I describe why these are necessary concepts to any reasoned debate on taxation.
Because these concepts, along with their underlying ontological and axiological assumptions are also concentious, I also provide a working vocabulary of economic philosophy to explicate the ideological import of these concepts.

Thirdly, imagine that our medical student is also quite particular about proper postures and requires subjects to concentrate on, say, the somewhat obscure and demanding *firefly pose*, along with four other precisely defined positions, and nothing else.
Her supervisors wonder why she could not use simpler, more mainstream positions, such as the *downward-facing dog*, or *really*, just some plain breathing exercises.
The medical student counters that *only* these selected five positions, evolved over centuries, form a well-rounded exercise regimen and rehearses some biomechanical research to support her claim.

This dissertation, too, is quite particular about the taxes to be deliberated on.
In chapter \@(hypotheticals) I argue, citing some mainstream economic research, that there are only a few, fundamental choices in taxation, given by the interaction of base and schedule.
I show that these choices are highly consequential, irreducibly political, and therefore, essential for deliberating citizens.

Fourth, the medical student informs her supervisors that, *unfortunately* the planned study cannot be undertaken in the usual clinical setting, but that because of all the required instruction, she will need to meet participants in person every morning for a group session at a local gym, which she will decorate appropriately with sandalwood incense.[^centerpiece]
Aghast upon hearing this latest proposal, one of the supervisors resigns from the committee and vows to never supervise a student again who so much as mentions Eastern philosophy.
The student studies existing treatment regimens, and argues that an intensive intervention is the only way to do this research.
She also finds two other studies with similar treatments, one even flew participants out to a Caribbean yoga retreat.
The remaining supervisors stay on, perhaps just hoping that the philosophizing will now come to an end, and the study reach firmer ground.

[^centerpiece]: This part is actually factual.
    At the behest of the trained moderators, we installed a vaguely new-agey centerpiece at the deliberation venue.
    It worked wonders.
    <!-- TODO refer to picture in the appendix -->

This study too, required an unconventional treatment regimen.
In chapter \@(civicon) I explain why, instead of the more usual short and large-n deliberative fora, to study taxation, a longer and more intensive format is necessary.
I review existing deliberative fora, and argue why their experimental value remains limited.
I describe the design of the **CiviCon Citizen Conference** I hosted as part of this dissertation.

Fifth, our aspiring clinician recognizes that measuring "mindfulness", her DV, is quite tricky.
Existing survey instruments seem too closed-ended, but entirely qualitative methods do not seem scientific enough for her.
Instead, she finds a clever way to holistically measure *different* experiences of mindfulness, and records how they change during the course of the treatment.

Measuring *whether* a forum was deliberative, and if so, what the *substantive effects* of the deliberation were may be yet more vexing than quantifying "mindfulness".
In chapter \@(q), I review existing measurements for deliberative quality, as well as their results and, finding most of them unsatisfactory for the present needs, suggest an application of rarely used Q-Methodology.


## Theory as Treatment

<!-- TODO a research question chapter is missing in the above, and that is in fact where, well, what is tested would be listed -->

What may strike readers as odd about the first couple of chapters is that these are wide-ranging, but in no way original.
They have the feeling of a *textbook*.
This is by design, and follows from the remedial aspiration of deliberation itself.
<!-- TODO explain why it needs didactic reduction etc. -->

Emphatically, the content of the theory chapters is also *nowhere* subject to an empirical test in this dissertation.
Much like our hypothetical medical student would not test whether participants could successfully do a *firefly pose*, I never test whether participants understand the deadweight-loss (DWL) of taxation, let alone whether, under which circumstances or to what extent, this abstraction is a positive phenomenon.
All these chapters have the status of *justifying* and *explicating* the *treatment*, that is, the framing and briefing for the deliberative forum.

<!-- TODO 
add plot here where/how these chapters feed into other objects/chapters, to really drive home how necessary they are. 
this might be a bigraph, with the different chapters on both sides as nodes, edges with descriptions in the middle
explain that the econ101 in chap 1-3 is *both* for readers, and for civicon participants, *and* for items
-->

<!-- Precisely, what we ought to do in all these chapters, hence also the axiology and philosophical stuff, we need to find whatever is *contentious* behind first order Questions
for example, behind the CIT
but this can only happen at the end, its axiomatic, and this just needs some time to develop-->

<!-- This stuff is what makes this diss a little complicated, but it's also about the only thing that makes it worthwhile, and perhaps, original -->
<!-- we need to get a lot of first-order questions out of the way, it is necessary, but weird -->


## Theory as Didactic Reduction

<!-- we need tax and the background, because this all needs Philosophy
in way, what this all is, is citizen science -->

<!-- I *am* actually concentrating here; there is *lot* that is not mentioned here:
- monetary policy (because it is a technical issue, at least for now)
- spending side (completely different ballgame, ends up making the whole thing wayyy to big and loosy-goosy)
- you gotta do this, otherwise it gets too fluffy -->

## Theory as Explanandum

<!-- You need to have a first-order theory that you need to explain -->
<!-- maybe do the whole first/second oder business here -->

<!-- notice where literature review happens -->

<!-- %project description
%universe, cases, variables
%temporal, spatial, social limits-->

<!-- Before specifying a format to investigate this question, I must note some of the substantive desiderata of deliberation and taxation that any operationalization will have to reflect, if it is to maintain construct validity. -->

## Payoff

This is probably an unconventional, and possibly risky project, but it has promise, too.

If, given the right design, deliberative democracy can enable citizens to rule on complex issues, political scientists will have a very able, and attractive hypothetical to compare with, and deliberative experimenters should have more courage to venture out to more topics facing our sovereigns.
Not just as social scientists, but as citizens too, we must know whether the once historical achievement of aggregative democracy is now withering away under the assault of tightly concentrated special interest and obscuring complexity.
If it can show its stripes, deliberative democracy may well be our last, and also our best hope, to reveal the perils of pluralism, then to live up to our greater capacity for communicative action.

If, under a normatively more attractive democratic process, people were to resolve some misunderstandings about, and agree on different, but doable and desirable taxes, welfare state research and political economy would have to explain a much greater retrenchment and democratic failure.
Not only as social scientists, but as citizens, too, we must know that better tax we could agree on, and if it exists, what is keeping us from it.
Taxation, underneath it all, *is* the social contract [@SchumpeterSwedberg-1942-aa], and its vitality will determine the prospects for modern progress.


## A Crime Story

This dissertation is fairly pedestrian.
I tread in some of the mundane minutiae of modernity;
initially the twists of tax, and later the details of democratic rule.
And yet, in that small print of the social contract, I have found a veritable crime story.

The story begins with (, p. ):
why, in the richest of countries, in the most enlightened of times (current day [oecd]{acronym-label="oecd" acronym-form="singular+short"}-world) do we still find ourselves amidst (, p. ):

1.  of welfare states, too constrained to elegantly improve upon the equity, efficiency and sustainability of markets,

2.  of democracies, too paralyzed to meaningfully rule their economies and

3.  consequently, of political equality and economic opportunity?

This lament alone does not mean there was crime:
maybe, these are no crises, but just facts of life, and a thorough investigation is unnecessary.
Likewise, we do not call in murder police when some centenarian does not wake up one morning.
However, at least, we task a doctor to establish a cause of death.
So it is with these three crises:
before any criminal investigation can start, I must establish a causal theory for constrained welfare, paralyzed democracy and rampant inequality.
I find that causal theory in the complex interactions of markets and plans, as they coexist in a (, p. ).
Specifically, I find that of the political institutions that make up an intact mixed economy, most to welfare, democracy and equality (, p. ).

This dissertation is staunchly reformist.
Just because a system may be in crisis, it does not require a revolutionary overhaul, nor does it warrant dialectical glee about its supposed inevitability.
I stick to the market economy *and* the welfare state, and merely tinker with tax to make them coexist better, and to mutual advantage.
There, I have found a scandal.

Our choice of tax can only be scandalous, let alone criminal, if there is, in fact, a better tax.
And so, in (p. ) I ask:
what makes a (, p. ) and what makes it (, p. )?
I evaluate all real and hypothetical taxes on these criteria, and find:
(progressive) taxes on the (unimproved) value of land and (postpaid) consumption are much than the ones we have (, p. ).
By comparison, our existing taxes on income and (prepaid) consumption appear staggeringly inefficient, inequitable and unsustainable.
Because the tax foundations of our mixed economies are thus sabotaged, our democracies must needlessly trade off efficiency, equity, and sustainability.

This dissertation is sociological, not just economic.
I cannot merely posit a suboptimal choice in tax, but I must theorize and test some social process to account for the supposedly suboptimal choice in tax.

is the social process that ought to rule collective choice (, p. ).
It, too, needs specification:
what it strive for (, p. ), and what it deliver (, p. )?
In the balance of these questions I find:
liberal, but deliberative democracy may be much than the representative institutions we have (, p. ).
By comparison, the status quo of pluralism appears to be a minimal formulation of liberal democracy, as skeptical about what people *can* do, as it is restrictive about what democracy *should* do.
Once a historical achievement, it today appears hopelessly outmatched by the vast complexity and tightly concentrated special interest of late capitalist society.

So, "who dunnit\"?
Because this dissertation is, at bottom, positivist, I cannot show what --- let alone *who* --- prevented a better tax, or a better democracy.
Non-events such as as land or consumption taxation and deliberative democracy are always causally underdetermined, just as history is always overdetermined.
For a detective, that is a bit of a let-down, but there is still work to be done.
I might not find the perpetrator, but at least, I can absolve wrongly accused democracy, and, during the hearing, spread word of the crime.

(p. ) investigates the link between .
I start by rounding up for suboptimal taxation (, p. ) and proceed --- as Holmes advises --- by the method of elimination.
First up:
democracy itself.
Maybe, "suboptimal" tax is, in fact, the *popular* choice.
Only if it is not, is there a failure of the political process to be puzzled over, and accounted for.
I suggest that tax choice depends on the *kind* of democracy.
Tax choice may suffer , because it is very complicated and offers tightly concentrated special interest (, p. ).
More broadly, the two crimes of suboptimal taxation and limited democracy are intimately related.
People might not just widely misunderstand taxation, but they might err systematically about the trade-offs of ruling a mixed economy.
These systematic misunderstandings under the dysfunctions of pluralism might interact with the unattractive alternatives of a dysfunctional tax regime to dramatically constrain any popular choice of tax, and divert the polity away from the equity, efficiency and sustainability they might otherwise prefer.
Democracy and taxation might be closely intertwined in their supposed mutual crises, but they also constitute two sides of the same coin that is the liberal-democratic, capitalist social contract.
Democracy concerns the making of collectively binding decisions, taxation is the chief means to implement these agreed-upon plans within the market exchanges of free agents.
Conversely, democracy legitimates tax and calls the trade-offs of the mixed economy, and taxation also shapes the material conditions under which people decide, and collects the resources to power policy.
Not surprisingly, democracy and taxation share , and their crises and reform hinge on the same questions of equality, justice, cooperation and human nature (, p. ).

This dissertation is also empirical.
To stay clear of hermetic ideology, and self-referential critique, I must get up from the normative armchair and show that really, a better democracy and better tax *are* related and *can* be had.

A good crime story cannot rely on conjecture alone, it needs supporting evidence.
I cannot provide an instrument of crime because history does not leave material what-ifs in its wake.
But I can try to capture these hypotheticals in an :
if ordinary
people, under an *alternative*, democratic process, choose an *alternative*, preferable tax, *that* would be as close to a smoking gun (, p. ) as it gets.
If, moreover, that experimental democracy can be shown to alleviate some of the dysfunctions of pluralism, and misunderstandings of the mixed economy, and if, consequently, through that democratic fora, people prefer an alternative tax, we know for sure that *some* crime *has* happened.

This dissertation is, lastly, , despite it all (, p. ):
the crime remains unsolved, and I can point to no single societal culprit.
Maybe, that is for the better, as few good things ever come from such structuralist exorcisms.
There may be many reasons why we have no better tax, and the *kind* of democracy we have might plausibly be one of them.
That alone ought to worry us.

If, in fact, our pluralist democracies are becoming illegitimate and inefficient, their increasing failures will plague many arenas of collective choice other than taxation.
The death knells of legitimate and efficient pluralism --- complexity and tightly concentrated special interest --- *are* the conditions of late capitalist society.
I that taxation may just be one these policy fields in which the limits of pluralism show early, and clearly (, p. ).
Indeed, the entire story could be told the other way around, with popular rule as the corpse that found its master in the intricacies of tax.

This dissertation is fairly long and not very original.
Others already have, in different places and with different foci, written almost all that is contained in the next pages.
And yet, so far, no one has bothered to connect the dots.
That is what I offer here.

Raymond @Williams1992 has argued that the detective story appears at roughly the same time as sociology, and for the same reason:
to penetrate the modern world, as Conan Doyle's *Sherlock Holmes* does, "by an isolated rational intelligence" [@Williams1992 88], otherwise covered by London fogs, or compartmentalized by functional differentiation [@Durkheim-1893-aa].
And so it is with this crime story of taxation and democracy:
shrouded in nebulous complexity, pigeonholed into disjunct institutions and areas of expertise, it needs a lot of detective work to connect these dots.
To hear this case, I urge the reader to consider all of the evidence reviewed in this exposition, even if some of the detail might, at first, seem trivial.
It is not.
As Sherlock Holmes reminds us, "there is nothing so important as trifles" [@Doyle1891 238].
From the incidence of the [cit]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="singular+short"}, the liquidity effects of taxing property to the macro- and micropolitics of democracy and the sociobiology of fairness, cooperation and equality
--- these "trifles" are all important exhibits to make the case that democracy, taxation, and with it, all our modern lives, *could*, and therefore, *should* be better.

Some stories just cannot be told in the short form, and the story I have stumbled upon and here report may be one of those.
Luckily, detective stories can also be fun to read, and so, I hope, is this one.

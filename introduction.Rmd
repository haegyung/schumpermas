# Introduction {#intro}

<!-- . Introduction [based on introduction] -->
<!--    - why does any of the following matter? -->
<!--    - because the *welfare state (or mixed economy)* is based on good taxation, and taxation is in crisis. -->
<!--    - because *representative/pluralist democracy* faces structural (dealignment) and inherent challenges (public choice); tax is that issue where these problems intersect. -->
<!--    - these possible crises of democracy and taxation may have a profound effect on *social and political equality* -->

<!-- > Why, in the most prosperous of economies, are we plagued by widening inequality, underfunded states and persistent unemployment?  
> Why, in the most enlightened of times, are we thoroughly confused about governing our mixed economies and perilously disaffected with the results our democratic rule produces? 
 
> **What if** there were alternative taxes, which afforded us more attractive tradeoffs between economic efficiency, equity and sustainability or other ends  
> **What if** we *could* agree on such alternative taxes, but *would not*, because we lacked the necessary information or suitable fora, and because our capacity for mutual reason-giving had been diminished by alienating inequality or clouded by special interest? -->

<!-- %Second, my research interest emerges from a sense of utter disconnect between political debate and the abstractions and interests governing the political economy.
%This dis-connect is evident in misleading sloganeering (‘Mehr Netto vom Brutto’, more net out of gross income), widespread superstitions (‘employers [sic!] pay half of social insurance’), bastard Keynesianism (‘consumption is good!’) or redistributive smoke grenades (‘we should tax companies’).
%At a deeper level, I wonder whether pluralist interest and electoral re-presentation can still be reasonably assumed to yield efficient and equitable policies, in an ever more complex world marred by cooperation problems. -->

If world history is still written in tax, as @Schumpeter believed, the people of our democracies, too, must read and speak these codes, to live up to the emancipatory promise of modernity.
If communicative action can heal the disagreement and confusion wrought as modernity differentiated System and Lifeworld, as @Habermas-1984 hopes, in our discourse on tax, too, universally acceptable validity claims instead of money and power must rule to uphold our faith in liberal democracy.
<!-- comment MN dependent on each theorie -->

I here probe into one intersection of legitimate inputs and outputs of the social contract [compare @Scharpf1997]: the discourse *on*, and economics *of* tax.

I ask, how --- if at all --- people under current democratic arrangements think and speak differently about tax, from how they *would* think and speak about it, if they lived under conditions of ideal speech.
<!-- not so much the speech with q any more ... -->
I test, how --- if at all --- people change their thinking and speech about tax, if they participate in a democratic process that is *closer* to the Habermasian ideal?
I hypothesize that --- as a result of *more* ideal speech --- people will prefer different taxes, including a PCT.
<!-- %rather than more, write closer to, more could be misunderstood -->


## Structure of the Dissertation {#structure}

The following chapters follow a fairly conventional structure from theory to methods to results and conclusion, but the *status* of especially the first couple of chapters may unclear to readers.
Out of substantive necessity, the references and disciplines in these first couple of chapters can be quite wide-ranging, though these are merely introductory (for the reader) and remedial (for the participants).
To clarify the role of these chapters, let me first situate them within the remainder of this dissertation.

This project is modeled on a straightforward experimental design, as it is frequently used in clinical studies.
However, because the study deals not with easily measurable biomarkers, but with subtleties of deliberation and the abstractions of text, the design can be hard to recognize.


### Research Design by Analogy

Consider an analogous example to let me guide you through the following chapters:
A doctoral candidate in medicine wants to study how a daily morning exercise affects mindfulness.
In this exercise study, the absence (or presence) of the morning routine is the *independent variable* (IV), the kind and level of mindfulness the *dependent variable*.
Analogously, in the present study, the participation in the CiviCon citizen conference is the *IV*, and subjectivities concerning taxation are the *DV*.[^no-rct]
<!-- TODO might cite some experimental design literature here -->

[^no-rct]: Proper experimental designs are often double-blind *randomly controlled trials* (RCT), but these additional rigors are not possible or deemed unnecessary for the present study on deliberation and taxation.

  - A fully **randomized treatment** is impossible, because participants in a deliberative forum will (and should) always be free to exit the sample.
  Because the universe of participants are all citizens, or even all human beings affected by the policy in question, even a reasonably representative quota sample will be hard to come by.
  Largely because of limited resource, the present study is a self-selected haphazard sample, described in more detail in chapter \@ref(civicon).
<!-- TODO ... is that the right reference? VK: it is.-->
  - A **control group** of non-participating citizens would be possible in the present study, but was not included because of limited resources.
  In any event, there were no expected background events or trends affecting the subjectivities concerning taxation of *both* treatment and control groups, so a control group was deemed dispensable.
  Whatever changes the participating citizens displayed are likely to be a result of the deliberation.
  - A **blind design** is impossible because participants will, by the nature of the treatment, always know whether they are participating in a deliberative forum, or not.
  There should be no *placebo* deliberations, though there may well be those formats worthy of such a label.
<!-- TODO refer to chapter were I diss other formats -->

We need to complicate this simple design only a little bit to bring it close the present study on deliberation and taxation, as shown in table \@ref(tab:commented-toc).

First, let us assume that our M.D. to be presents good reasons to concentrate on a *particular* kind of exercise, say, hatha yoga.
Perhaps, the aspiring doctor argues convincingly that hatha yoga is an especially promising treatment, or that it has been previously understudied, or that really, "exercise" without the kind of body-awareness honed by hatha yoga is a meaningless concept, likely to yield only spurious effects, if any.

So it is with this research on deliberation and taxation.
In chapter \@ref(3-crises) I argue that taxation is a key, yet understudied precondition for a functioning mixed-economy and that to be effective, deliberation needs to engage with highly structured and abstract topics such as tax.

Secondly, suppose that our M.D.-hopeful insists on teaching the participants not just some positions, but also other related practices such covering diet (*mitahara*), body cleansing (*shatkarma*), breathing (*pranayama*) as well as some philosophical background.
At this point, her supervisors get a little anxious and worry where this might all lead.
However, our medical student maintains that concentrating on exercise alone is alien to the tradition and shows how the elements of hatha yoga are neatly intertwined.
She is the first to admit that she is not an expert in philosophy, let alone buddhist philosophy, but she is confident that she can provide at least *some* helpful background for participants do understand the broader context.

Analogously, this dissertation also requires some deep background for participants and readers alike.
In chapter \@ref(abstractions), I rehearse a few selected abstractions of taxation and microeconomics, including optimality, incidence, the Haig-Simons equivalence of income, the circular flow of the economy and implications of personal taxation.
I describe why these are necessary concepts to any reasoned debate on taxation.
Because these concepts, along with their underlying ontological and axiological assumptions are also concentious, I also provide a working vocabulary of economic philosophy to explicate the ideological import of these concepts.

Thirdly, imagine that our medical student is also quite particular about proper postures and requires subjects to concentrate on, say, the somewhat obscure and demanding *firefly pose*, along with four other precisely defined positions, and nothing else.
Her supervisors wonder why she could not use simpler, more mainstream positions, such as the *downward-facing dog*, or *really*, just some plain breathing exercises.
The medical student counters that *only* these selected five positions, evolved over centuries, form a well-rounded exercise regimen and rehearses some biomechanical research to support her claim.

This dissertation, too, is quite particular about the taxes to be deliberated on.
In chapter \@(hypotheticals) I argue, citing some mainstream economic research, that there are only a few, fundamental choices in taxation, given by the interaction of base and schedule.
I show that these choices are highly consequential, irreducibly political, and therefore, essential for deliberating citizens.

Fourth, the medical student informs her supervisors that, *unfortunately* the planned study cannot be undertaken in the usual clinical setting, but that because of all the required instruction, she will need to meet participants in person every morning for a group session at a local gym, which she will decorate appropriately with sandalwood incense.[^centerpiece]
Aghast upon hearing this latest proposal, one of the supervisors resigns from the committee and vows to never supervise a student again who so much as mentions Eastern philosophy.
The student studies existing treatment regimens, and argues that an intensive intervention is the only way to do this research.
She also finds two other studies with similar treatments, one even flew participants out to a Caribbean yoga retreat.
The remaining supervisors stay on, perhaps just hoping that the philosophizing will now come to an end, and the study reach firmer ground.

[^centerpiece]: This part is actually factual.
    At the behest of the trained moderators, we installed a vaguely new-agey centerpiece at the deliberation venue.
    It worked wonders.
    <!-- TODO refer to picture in the appendix -->

This study too, required an unconventional treatment regimen.
In chapter \@(civicon) I explain why, instead of the more usual short and large-n deliberative fora, to study taxation, a longer and more intensive format is necessary.
I review existing deliberative fora, and argue why their experimental value remains limited.
I describe the design of the **CiviCon Citizen Conference** I hosted as part of this dissertation.

Fifth, our aspiring clinician recognizes that measuring "mindfulness", her DV, is quite tricky.
Existing survey instruments seem too closed-ended, but entirely qualitative methods do not seem scientific enough for her.
Instead, she finds a clever way to holistically measure *different* experiences of mindfulness, and records how they change during the course of the treatment.

Measuring *whether* a forum was deliberative, and if so, what the *substantive effects* of the deliberation were may be yet more vexing than quantifying "mindfulness".
In chapter \@(q), I review existing measurements for deliberative quality, as well as their results and, finding most of them unsatisfactory for the present needs, suggest an application of rarely used Q-Methodology.


## Theory as Treatment

<!-- TODO a research question chapter is missing in the above, and that is in fact where, well, what is tested would be listed -->

What may strike readers as odd about the first couple of chapters is that these are wide-ranging, but in no way original.
They have the feeling of a *textbook*.
This is by design, and follows from the remedial aspiration of deliberation itself.
<!-- TODO explain why it needs didactic reduction etc. -->

Emphatically, the content of the theory chapters is also *nowhere* subject to an empirical test in this dissertation.
Much like our hypothetical medical student would not test whether participants could successfully do a *firefly pose*, I never test whether participants understand the deadweight-loss (DWL) of taxation, let alone whether, under which circumstances or to what extent, this abstraction is a positive phenomenon.
All these chapters have the status of *justifying* and *explicating* the *treatment*, that is, the framing and briefing for the deliberative forum.

<!-- TODO 
add plot here where/how these chapters feed into other objects/chapters, to really drive home how necessary they are. 
this might be a bigraph, with the different chapters on both sides as nodes, edges with descriptions in the middle
explain that the econ101 in chap 1-3 is *both* for readers, and for civicon participants, *and* for items
-->

<!-- Precisely, what we ought to do in all these chapters, hence also the axiology and philosophical stuff, we need to find whatever is *contentious* behind first order Questions
for example, behind the CIT
but this can only happen at the end, its axiomatic, and this just needs some time to develop-->

<!-- This stuff is what makes this diss a little complicated, but it's also about the only thing that makes it worthwhile, and perhaps, original -->
<!-- we need to get a lot of first-order questions out of the way, it is necessary, but weird -->


## Theory as Didactic Reduction

<!-- we need tax and the background, because this all needs Philosophy
in way, what this all is, is citizen science -->

<!-- I *am* actually concentrating here; there is *lot* that is not mentioned here:
- monetary policy (because it is a technical issue, at least for now)
- spending side (completely different ballgame, ends up making the whole thing wayyy to big and loosy-goosy)
- you gotta do this, otherwise it gets too fluffy -->

## Theory as Explanandum

<!-- You need to have a first-order theory that you need to explain -->
<!-- maybe do the whole first/second oder business here -->

<!-- notice where literature review happens -->

<!-- %project description
%universe, cases, variables
%temporal, spatial, social limits-->

<!-- Before specifying a format to investigate this question, I must note some of the substantive desiderata of deliberation and taxation that any operationalization will have to reflect, if it is to maintain construct validity. -->

## Payoff

This is probably an unconventional, and possibly risky project, but it has promise, too.

If, given the right design, deliberative democracy can enable citizens to rule on complex issues, political scientists will have a very able, and attractive hypothetical to compare with, and deliberative experimenters should have more courage to venture out to more topics facing our sovereigns.
Not just as social scientists, but as citizens too, we must know whether the once historical achievement of aggregative democracy is now withering away under the assault of tightly concentrated special interest and obscuring complexity.
If it can show its stripes, deliberative democracy may well be our last, and also our best hope, to reveal the perils of pluralism, then to live up to our greater capacity for communicative action.

If, under a normatively more attractive democratic process, people were to resolve some misunderstandings about, and agree on different, but doable and desirable taxes, welfare state research and political economy would have to explain a much greater retrenchment and democratic failure.
Not only as social scientists, but as citizens, too, we must know that better tax we could agree on, and if it exists, what is keeping us from it.
Taxation, underneath it all, *is* the social contract [@SchumpeterSwedberg-1942-aa], and its vitality will determine the prospects for modern progress.

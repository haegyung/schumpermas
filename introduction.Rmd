# (PART) Theory {-}

# Introduction

> The spirit of a people, its cultural level, its social structure, the deeds its polity may prepare – all this and more is written in its fiscal history, stripped of all phrases.
> He who knows how to listen to its message here discerns the **thunder of world history** more clearly than anywhere else.  
> –– Joseph Schumpeter (1918: 6)

> Reaching understanding, (...) **the inherent telos of human speech**.  
> –– Jürgen Habermas (1987: 287)

> Why, in the most prosperous of economies, are we plagued by widening inequality, underfunded states and persistent unemployment?  
> Why, in the most enlightened of times, are we thoroughly confused about governing our mixed economies and perilously disaffected with the results our democratic rule produces? 
 
> **What if** there were alternative taxes, which afforded us more attractive tradeoffs between economic efficiency, equity and sustainability or other ends  
> **What if** we *could* agree on such alternative taxes, but *would not*, because we lacked the necessary information or suitable fora, and because our capacity for mutual reason-giving had been diminished by alienating inequality or clouded by special interest?


<!-- . Introduction [based on introduction] -->
<!--    - why does any of the following matter? -->
<!--    - because the *welfare state (or mixed economy)* is based on good taxation, and taxation is in crisis. -->
<!--    - because *representative/pluralist democracy* faces structural (dealignment) and inherent challenges (public choice); tax is that issue where these problems intersect. -->
<!--    - these possible crises of democracy and taxation may have a profound effect on *social and political equality* -->

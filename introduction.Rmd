If world history is still written in tax, as @Schumpeter believed, the people of our democracies, too, must read and speak these codes, to live up to the emancipatory promise of modernity.
If communicative action can heal the disagreement and confusion wrought as modernity differentiated System and Lifeworld, as @Habermas-1984 hopes, in our discourse on tax, too, universally acceptable validity claims instead of money and power must rule to uphold our faith in liberal democracy.
<!-- comment MN dependent on each theorie -->

I here probe into one intersection of legitimate inputs and outputs of the social contract [compare @Scharpf1997]: the discourse *on*, and economics *of* tax.

I ask, how --- if at all --- people under current democratic arrangements think and speak differently about tax, from how they *would* think and speak about it, if they lived under conditions of ideal speech.
<!-- not so much the speech with q any more ... -->
I test, how --- if at all --- people change their thinking and speech about tax, if they participate in a democratic process that is *closer* to the Habermasian ideal?
I hypothesize that --- as a result of *more* ideal speech --- people will prefer different taxes, including a PCT.
<!-- %rather than more, write closer to, more could be misunderstood -->


## Taxation and Welfare

Why does taxation matter for human welfare?

As @Schumpeter knew, "in the modern world, taxation *is* the social contract" [@Martin2009a, 1, emphasis in original], even though social scientists have since paid little attention to it [@Tilly2009, K191].
Tax matters especially for current OECD-style welfare regimes, in which markets and states must co-exist [@Stiglitz2011].
In such a mixed economy, government must be able to draft some privately-owned resources to serve its --- ideally democratic --- *command*, without unduly altering the prices of --- ideally competitive --- *exchanges* [@Ardant1975, 165f]. 
<!-- TODO ref chapter on mixed econ here -->
Much of modern social integration occurs in the balance of these two contrasting logics to produce and allocate resources, "enmesh[ing] us in the web of generalized reciprocity that constitutes modern society" [@Martin2009a, 3].
State plans make the conditions *for*, and set limits *to* *individual* action, as when government builds roads or collects sewage fees.
Conversely, market exchanges produce much of the "fungible resources" used for *collective* choice, as when government pays road builders or procures sewage pipes [@Martin2009a, 4].

Of all conceivable institutions to govern the interface of states and markets, taxation --- not price controls, not expropriation, not debt, not printing money, not tariffs --- is the most equitable, efficient and sustainable [@MusgThet1959; @Stiglitz2011].
<!-- TODO ref tax-matters chapter -->
Welfare states, with their penchant for market interventions for equity, efficiency *and* sustainability, especially, rely on good taxes.

<!-- %bad überleitung, the instead doesnt work -->
Still, taxation everywhere in the OECD is in crisis.
As alternative sources of economic relief --- monetary expansion and sovereign debt --- are maxed out, structural misalignments persist, and previously forestalling (asset) bubbles have burst into their days of reckoning, public revenues appear to be strictly limited by the longtime coming contradictions of current tax regimes [@Streeck2013].
<!-- %not sure about this soure, must read it -->
The popular mixture of (progressive) income, (proportional) consumption and (regressive) payroll taxes appears to offer only harshly unattractive tradeoffs between equity and efficiency [@McCafferyHines2010], as bases have shrunk and schedules flattened [@Ganghof2006].
At the same time --- possibly partly as a result --- inequalities of incomes and wealth have widened [@Butterwegge; @Wagner2007; @Grabka2007].[^no_wealth_distro]
<!-- TODO mention here that inequality findings are contentious -->

[^no_wealth_distro]: Data on the distribution of wealth is conspicuously hard to come by [@Crouch2004, 158] or ordinally summarized in deciles, rendering much of the inequality invisible.

If governments cannot raise the resources necessary to meet democratic demands without incurring prohibitive costs, the social contract is fraying [@Crouch2004].
<!-- %so so shource -->
Whichever way governments now turn, absent better tax, they will violate the post-war capitalist compact of stable, widely shared growth [@Pierson2002; @StreeckMertens2010].
<!-- %so-so source -->
<!-- TODO ref 3-crisis chapter -->


## Deliberation and Democracy

Why does deliberating taxation matter for democracy?

A dysfunctional mixed economy without good taxes may produce illegitimate outputs, and, in so far as it disturbs the state-market balance of the mixed economy, violates output congruence of a democracy [compare @Zurn-2000-aa 190].
Yet, even if experts could agree on a tax --- such as a promising, post-paid, cash-flow based [pct]{acronym-label="pct" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- the tradeoffs involved in choosing or calibrating a tax regime are irreducibly political.
For example, experts cannot *positively* inquire whether economic "growth" [^positive_sum] is in itself *virtuous*, which inter-subjective aggregation would be *utility-maximizing*, what *deontological* rights owners have or which human *relationships* should be governed by prices or command at all --- even if they could agree on any of those alternative ethics.

[^positive_sum]: More precisely, the reaping of greater non-zero-sumness from social integration [@Wright2000].

<!-- TODO these are all discussed in *wanted* chapter -->
<!-- Even to the extent that tax choice can be left to economic a-priori or empirical analyses, of, for example, \glspl{dwl}, such expertise relies on contentious views of human nature \citep[for a review,][]{Persky1995}, and observations of nature are, in any event, devoid of moral messages \citep[43]{Gould1982}. -->
These metaphysical conundrums are reflected in very concrete, technocratic issues in taxation.
<!-- TODO add complete list here, those are old links issues in taxation, including \glspl{dwl} (p.~\pageref{sec:tax-optimality}), \hyperref[sec:diminishing-marginal-utility]{diminishing marginal utility} (p.~\pageref{sec:diminishing-marginal-utility}), the \hyperref[des:structural-agnosticism]{treatment of capital income} (p.~\pageref{des:structural-agnosticism}), or \hyperref[sec:love-marriage]{joint spousal taxation} (p.~\pageref{sec:love-marriage}), respectively. -->
Likewise, experts cannot justify the axioms on which their (economic) analyses rest:
whether, and under which institutional circumstances we are homines oeconomici, cannot be exhaustively answered from observation, because nature provides no intelligible moral messages on what kind of man we *should* be [@Gould1982 43].
<!-- again reference wanted chapter -->
This ontological stance matters for tax, too:
for an expert to model a general equilibrium is to invoke, as well as to make, a homo economicus.

Of all conceivable institutions to resolve these disagreements, deliberative --- not aggregative, not pluralist, not participatory --- democracy offers the greatest normative appeal, because these disagreements raise, in @Habermas-1984's words, competing *validity claims*, in need of argumentative redemption, as in:
is "growth" *comprehensible*, who *truly* bears a [cit]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="singular+short"}, is homo economicus *right*, and are social insurance employer co-payments *truthful*?
I illustrate further more, and less valid claims on taxation.
<!-- %I illustrate further more -- language does not work -->
<!-- TODO referer to validity-claims tex table here! -->
<!-- TODO INPUT validity claims table here! -->

Liberal democracy, born out of the hope that material inequality and political autonomy *can* be reconciled, especially, rests on deliberation, because if anywhere, it is in taxation that money and power may have replaced language to govern meaning and action [@Habermas-1971].
In fact, if you wanted to hide some process of (re)producing inequality anywhere, you could hardly find a better place than the intricacies of (income) taxation (consider, for example "tax planning 101" in @McCaffery2005 [888]).

Instead of communicative action [@Habermas-1984], what emerges today from citizens, their legislatures and public spheres, may be more "analytic muddle of tax" [@McCaffery2005 862].
The beliefs held and issues considered in the public [for example, @Caplan2007], appear to bear little resemblance to the abstractions suggested by economists [for example, @Harberger1974].
People seem to ignore fundamental choices in tax [for example, @McCafferyHines2010], and may fall for inconsequential alternatives [for example, @SausgruberTyran2011], possibly even err systematically against their own material interest --- if they are on the lower economic rungs [for a German example, @Kemmerling2009].
Here, too, (input) congruence of democratic rule may be violated if and to the extent that people are confused about policy choices [compare @Zurn-2000-aa 90].

These two crises --- an ineffective and/or inefficient welfare state and a confused democracy --- may partly reinforce one another into one perfect storm of societal reaction by stealth:

> The two issues, the crisis of egalitarian politics and the trivialization of democracy, are not necessarily the same.
> Egalitarians might say that they do not care how manipulative of democracy a government is, provided it divides society's wealth and power more evenly.
> A conservative democrat will point out that improving the quality of political debate need not necessarily result in more redistributive policies.
> But at certain crucial points, the two issues do intersect [\ldots].
> My central contentions are that while the forms of democracy remain fully in place --- and today in some respects are actually strengthened --- politics and governments are increasingly slipping back into the control of privileged elites in the manner characteristic of pre-democratic times;
> and that one major consequence of this process is the growing impotence of egalitarian causes.
> --- Colin @Crouch2004 [6]


## Raw and Enlightened Thinking and Speech

I here propose to investigate a supposed difference in current, and (more) ideal speech thinking about tax by subjecting a group of diverse citizens to a deliberative forum on the topic, which, in one succinct summary [@Steenbergen2003 25ff], is marked by

1. open *participation*, including setting the agenda and deciding on procedures (@Benhabib-1996-aa, @Chambers1995, @Cohen-1989-aa, @Habermas1992 [370ff])
2. mutual *justification* of assertions and validity claims [@Habermas1992 370],
3. orientation on the *common good* [@Rawls-1971],
<!-- not sure about this, it's kinda downstream from habermas -->
4. *respect* for one another, as well as one's arguments (@Gutmann1996, @Macedo1999), other-directedness, empathy and solidarity,
5. *constructive politics* of a widely acceptable decision over well-defined policy alternatives, ideally --- though not necessarily --- by consensus [@Cohen-1989-aa 23],
6.  *authenticity* in sincere, not strategic communication [@Habermas-1984 149]
<!-- %add here, maybe: manifest equality as demanded by Cohen -->

<!-- TODO insert this alternative list:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item reasonably accurate and complete \emph{information},
%	\item substantive \emph{balance} of possibly competing arguments and perspectives presented,
%	\item \emph{diversity} of participants and their positions taken,
%	\item a sincere weighting of arguments by participants, or \emph{conscientiousness}
%	\item equal consideration of all arguments, regardless of which participant offered them \cite[K1799]{Fishkin2009}.
%\end{enumerate} -->

Such a difference $\Delta$ between "raw" and "enlightened" thinking,
beliefs [@Caplan2007] and preferences [@Fishkin2009] is worth knowing for several reasons:

1.  There may be *agreeable*, doable but hypothetical taxes, which may (Pareto)-improve over current taxes [@Harberger1974] or may be fairer [@Rawls-1971] and more sustainable [@Solow1956], including a [@Mill1848; @McCaffery2002; @Frank2005a; @Seidman1997], a [@George1879; @Buiter1988] and a [@Friedman1962].
    By comparison, existing taxes appear unnecessarily wasteful, inequitable and unsustainable.[^oecd-taxes]
    <!-- COMMENT MN würde dieses Wissen schon so eingespeist? Bias? -->
    
    These suboptimal tax regimes may present democratic sovereigns with needlessly harsh tradeoffs between efficiency, equity, sustainability and other competing ends.
    The means of an intact mixed economy [@MusgThet1959; @Stiglitz2011] may consequently erode or even force retrenched welfare states into "permanent austerity" [@Pierson2002; @StreeckMertens2010] as it becomes harder for them to reconcile planned allocation and market exchange through taxation.
    
    Public confusion about taxation may be a contributing factor, or even a sufficient --- but not a necessary --- condition for the non-existence of these supposedly superior taxes.

2.  Progressivity in tax, especially, may hinge upon an enlightened, "new understanding of tax" [@McCaffery2005], as the historic mainstay of redistribution --- the [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- withers away in the face of its inherent contradictions [@McCafferyHines2010].
    People may understand tax *systematically* different from how they would under (more) ideal speech, which may cause them to choose less effectively progressive taxes than they otherwise might, or otherwise inadvertently act even against their material self-interest.
    Additionally, the difference between raw and enlightened thinking about tax may, in itself, depend on the socio-economic status of citizens.
    Taken together, such socially structured and structuring differences in understanding tax may contribute to further, or perpetuate existing social inequality, even under nominal political equality.

3.  The aggregative and representative institutions of liberal-pluralist democracy may be partly outmatched by the vexing complexity [@Merton-1968-aa] and tightly concentrated interest [@Olson-1971-aa] of late market economies, such as in taxation, violating both their input and output legitimacy [@Scharpf1997] as well as basic democratic prescriptions for "enlightened understanding" [@Dahl-1989-aa].
    Empirical political sociology bears out such popular dissatisfaction, not with democracy it self, but with incumbents, enamored by special interest, and inattentive to the public good [@NyeJr.1997; @Norris2011; @PutnamPharr-2000-aa].
    If such a "post-democratic" constellation [@Crouch2004] were to plague the polity in its thinking about tax, it may well affect other policy areas too.

[^oecd-taxes]: In the [oecd]{acronym-label="oecd" acronym-form="singular+short"}-world, those are varying combinations of pre-paid, proportional consumption taxes such as [vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"} and income taxes, often with different schedules for labor, capital and corporate incomes.
    Wealth taxes, often only on some asset classes, exist in some jurisdictions, but --- with the exception of local US property taxes --- are not a large revenue source.

<!-- . Introduction [based on introduction] -->
<!--    - why does any of the following matter? -->
<!--    - because the *welfare state (or mixed economy)* is based on good taxation, and taxation is in crisis. -->
<!--    - because *representative/pluralist democracy* faces structural (dealignment) and inherent challenges (public choice); tax is that issue where these problems intersect. -->

## State of the field

This positive aspect of this thesis sits at the intersection of two fields of empirical research:

1.  Practical experiments with different deliberative fora on varying policy areas,
2.  Experimental and survey research about popular understandings of tax.

<!-- In the following, I briefly report key findings from these three fields and identify avenues for further research. -->

### Empirical Deliberation

#### Deliberative Experiments

Deliberative fora have been tried on a number of policy areas and places, including renewable energy in Texas (USA) [@LehrGuild-2003-aa], participatory budgeting in Porto Allegre [@CoelhoPozzono-2005-aa] (Brasil), nanotechnology [@Powell2008], electoral reform in British Columbia (Canada), policing and education in Chicago (Illinois) [@WarrenPearse-2008-aa], and city planning in Philadelphia (Pennsylvannia) [@Sokoloff2005].
They also vary in their institutional design [reviewed in @Fung-2003-ac].
These include several small-n, multi-day designs, such as Citizen Juries [@SmithWales-2000-aa] or Planning Cells [@Dienel-1999-aa], where a few randomly selected citizens hear expert witness and deliberate amongst themselves for a couple of days, all facilitated by trained, non-expert moderators and prepared by a balanced briefing book to draft a Citizen's Report or similar consensus recommendation.
The otherwise similar Consensus Conferences [@Einsiedel2000] are often (much) longer, feature extended learning periods and are typically held on highly technical issues.[^consensus_conferences]

[^consensus_conferences]: Consensus Conferences were first developed and hosted in Denmark by the Technology Assessment Board to collect informed popular input for regulating science and technology.

Deliberation has also been tried in large-n, shorter designs with a more quantitative methodology in [dp]{acronym-label="dp" acronym-form="singular+short"}s [@FishkinFarrar-2005-aa], where hundreds of randomly selected citizens receive issue books, deliberate in small, moderated groups and plenary sessions, hear expert witnesses and --- instead of reaching a consensus --- cast a secret vote or fill out a questionnaire, after the typically daylong deliberation concludes.
Often, these survey results are compared to answers provided by participants before the event, and/or to a control group of non-participants, allowing quasi-experimental within-subject or between-subject statistical inferences.[^drop_out]

[^drop_out]: Because participants can always drop out at will and will know when they are in the treatment condition, treatment cannot be strictly randomly assigned.

There is quite limited experience with long, large-n designs, including --- to my knowledge --- only the [@WarrenPearse-2008-aa] that spanned several months, and included several hundred participants who were offered stipends and accommodation, participated in extended learning sessions, attended public hearings and ultimately agreed to recommend a new electoral system (a [stv]{acronym-label="stv" acronym-form="singular+short"}) for the province [@Citizen-2004-aa].
<!-- MN true, but it failed? -->

<!-- TODO include tables from google doc. -->

Across these different designs and purposes, deliberative fora have been shown to improve knowledge of the subject matter in question, to change --- but not bifurcate --- beliefs [@Fishkin2009], to yield more orderly and orthogonal preferences structures [@Farrar2003] and to boost a sense of political efficacy or mutual trust even among disempowered citizens [@Karpowitz2009].

These encouraging findings on the capacity of deliberation to strengthen democratic rule notwithstanding, much of deliberative practice may be criticized for often focusing on the immediate, tangible and remaining "confined to the realm of neighborhood and locale" [@FungWright-2001-aa 17].
<!-- COMMENT MN das sind aber nicht die Hauptkriterien? -->
This includes not only the overtly "human-scale" democratic efforts [@Boggs-1997-aa 759] of participatory budgeting [@Sousa-Santos-1998-aa], city planning [@Sokoloff2005] or public stewardship of forests [@Cheng2005], but also the much-lauded [dps]{acronym-label="dp" acronym-form="plural+short"}, which have, even when they were about clearly large-scale issues such as the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} [@Fishkin2009] or renewable energy use [@LehrGuild-2003-aa] mostly shied away from the very structured choices and remote abstractions which policy must engage.
These [dps]{acronym-label="dp" acronym-form="plural+short"} have, for example, demonstrated that more people prefer [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} enlargement and more people would be willing to pay a premium for renewables [@Fishkin2009 157], but did *not* ask --- and probably not deliberate on, either --- whether the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} was an [oca]{acronym-label="oca" acronym-form="singular+short"}, and if not, what fiscal complements might have to be implemented [for example, @Mundell1961], or by which process *competing* renewable energies should be chosen, especially if they depend on economies of scale and network effects [for example, @Krugman-1990-aa].
Clearly, these are only two haphazardly selected examples of abstractions ([oca]{acronym-label="oca" acronym-form="singular+short"}) and choices (infant industry regulation) relevant to these topics, but equally clearly, someone, somewhere in the democratic process has to make these calls.
<!-- %fishkin quote in the above is K2010 -->

Some of these more technocratic considerations may be rightly relegated to experts, but for others --- including the abstractions of tax --- this may not be possible or desirable as discussed in the above.
In terms of @Landwehr2010, [dps]{acronym-label="dp" acronym-form="plural+short"} may not be sufficiently "coordinative" to be fully deliberative, and not only because they do not enforce a collectively binding decision [-@Landwehr2010 377].
Absent abstractions, "coordinativeness" suffers because the policy options (for example, "faster [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} expansion") in which preferences are expressed [-@Landwehr2010 375] are ill-defined (for example, *what kind* of european integration?).
If such expressed preferences are allowed to detach from ontologically given policy options (for example, currency union with our without fiscal complements), people can effectively "exit" from substantial agreement [@Landwehr2010 377]:
"deliberators" can just talk, which may still be desirable, but stretches the concept too thin [@Thompson2008 502].
<!-- %Or, in the words of \cite[2]{Moore2011} ``the broadly democratic idea that people ought to have equality of opportunity to contribute to deliberation on matters that affect them is undermined by the huge and manifold inequalities in knowledge that are necessary for the effective analysis, regulation and management of complex social and technological problems'' -->

To show its stripes --- or limits (!) --- deliberative democracy must be tried on such highly structured choices and abstract issues, too.
<!-- %COMMENT MN notwendigkeit der verbindung mit Entscheidungskompetenz? -->
So far, with the notable exception of some Danish (small-n) Consensus Conferences and the (large-n) [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"} [on its complexity, @Blais2008], such applications are lacking in empirical experiments with deliberation.
If deliberative practice continues to blank out governing abstractions and structured choices --- the very stuff of the modern world and its political rule --- it risks moving "in a defensive and insular direction, laying bare a process of conservative retreat beneath a facile rhetoric of grassroots activism" [@Boggs-1997-aa 759].[^drawing_delib]

[^drawing_delib]: A comically naive example of such retreat comes from Piombino, Italy, where schoolchildren were "involved" (sic!) in urban renewal of the town piazza:

    > "After school trips (...) they had to make drawings of how the piazza should look.
    > These often very colorful and joyful drawings were exhibited and also put on the website of the town."

    Praises @Steiner2012 [29]:
    "In this way, children learned a good lesson about practical politics with a very concrete case of policy-making" (sic!).
    These and other exercises in "involvement" may be pedagogically or otherwise valuable, but *emancipatory* deliberation they are not.
    In fact, the example of children seems awfully revealing as an operative metaphor for this kind of "deliberative" citizen:
    let them draw cute pictures, or busy themselves with otherwise inconsequential activities, so that they feel heard.
<!-- %in a different, more positive vein, \cite[4f]{Boswell2013} describes such deliberative designs as concerned with `` `low politics', where the stakes are lower, the glare of publicity less pronounced and the local knowledge of citizens more prized. -->
<!-- we could also be infavor of this, simply as a kind of societal glue -->

#### Academic Reflection

These and other deliberative fora have also received ample academic reflection.

One strand of positive research treats deliberation as the *independent* variable, investigating its effects (including @Bachtiger2005 on legislatures, @Hibbings2002 on power differentials or @Jackman2008 on better-grounded judgements).
<!-- %fishkin 1991, niemer 2002, Hansen 2004, Schneiderhahn und Kahn 2008 all do effects -->
In a similar vein, [@Steiner2004] studied in how far deliberatively reached decisions "correspond to criteria of social justice" [@Steiner2012 13], by which they seem to mean a utilitarian maxim [@Bentham1789] or the @Rawls-1971ian difference principle [@Steiner2012 95].[^steiner_v_rawls]

[^steiner_v_rawls]: @Steiner2012 presents a questionable summary of @Rawls-1971:
    > This principle states that in a political decision the most disadvantaged social groups should profit the most [@Steiner2012 95].
    
    He finds it expressed when a parliamentarian says:
    
    > The government's priority must be to help those who have the greatest difficulty in paying rather then spreading it evenly across the range.
    
    The difference principle actually states that "social and economic *inequalities* are to \[...\] be to the greatest benefit to the least advantaged members of society" [@Rawls-1971 266], a complex and conditional claim to moral validity that is characteristically degraded in both the operationalization and the coded snippet.

In other work, deliberation is the *dependent* variable, investigating its causes (including @Steiner2004 on institutional aspects or @Steiner2012 [13] on issue polarization).
Similarly, [@Landwehr2010] compare how the *discursiveness* and *coordinativeness* of parliamentary debates and citizen conferences on regulating embryonic stem cell research impacts resultant preference change, their proxy for deliberation.
Employing a more sophisticated and theory-grounded operationalization than most, @Landwehr2010 [377] analyze speech acts to code for arguing (for example, "to claim") and bargaining (for example, "to offer").
<!-- %developed in Holzinger 2001, also Niemeyer. -->

Lastly, researchers simply seek to operationalize deliberation.
For instance, [@Stromer-Galley2007] suggests a coding scheme, including "reasoned opinion expression" when people provide "a definition, a reason for holding the opinion, an example, a story, a statistic, or fact, a hypothetical example, a solution to the problem, further explanation for why the problem is a problem, an analogy, \[...\] or any further attempt to say what they mean or why they have taken the position that they have".

These academic reflections all try to abstract away the substantive issues at stake in the respective deliberative encounters.
Social scientists, here, as often, are loath to get caught in first-order conflicts over, say, school policy:
"\[...\] measuring the factuality or quality of reasoning was deemed unnecessary" [@Stromer-Galley2007 10].
This impulse is understandable, even commendable:
Social scientists are, by definition, in the business of explaining the second-order social conflict *over* normative and positive first-order questions [compare @GutmannThompson-2004-aa 12] and must generalize from the particular to build or test social theory.
Yet, since deliberation is a *discourse* ethic [@GutmannThompson-2002-aa 153], it is difficult to analyze without the actual, domain-specific discourse.
The operationalizations employed vary widely, ranging from the crudely statistical [@Steiner2012] [^count_interruptions] to the quick-and-dirty semantical [@Steiner2012] [^dqi_def] to promisingly speech-act linguistic [@Landwehr2010].

[^count_interruptions]: Summarizes @Steiner2012:
    "It is noteworthy that of the 1,027 speech acts, only 5 were interrupted by other participants, which indicates a calm and not boisterous atmosphere during the experiments" [-@Steiner2012 47].

[^dqi_def]: "\[O\]ur [dqi]{acronym-label="dqi" acronym-form="singular+short"} defined a sophisticated level of justification as having a certain complexity in the sense that an argument is justified with more than one reason and that these reasons are logically linked with the postulated outcome" [@Steiner2012 64].

The [dqi]{acronym-label="dqi" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- even in @Steenbergen2003's more exacting formulation --- and other such operationalizations "can be applied easily and reliably to a wide range of deliberative contexts" [@Steenbergen2003 22], but that very decontextualization makes it hard to adjudicate whether really, universal validity was discussed, let alone reciprocally acclaimed.
I share the uneasyness of "critical theorists and postmodernists" [@Steiner2012 11] with this measure of quality of deliberation --- though I do not think you have to be either to object, nor for the same reasons.[^postmodern_criticism_of_dqi]

[^postmodern_criticism_of_dqi]: [@King2009] criticizes that coded interpretations are presented as objective fact, rather than inter-subjective. 

Rather than *how many* justifications were given in total, or *how often* people referred to counterarguments [@Steenbergen2003 29], I want to know whether these reasons corresponded in *substantive terms to those they disagree with*.
I provide a hypothetical exchange from deliberating taxation to illustrate my point:

<!-- TODO fix dialogue -->
**Foundationalist**
^[Inspired by the Philosophy of Robert [@Nozick1974].]
I believe that everyone should be entitled to incomes generated from uncoerced exchange with others.

**Social Democrat**
^[Not very inspired, and by no one in particular.]
Yeah, obviously we are not going to take away all of a person's income, they should be entitled to it, but maybe we'll take some of it because we need that for education.
That's not going to hurt them.
<!-- COMMENT MN social democrats/socialists will also always want to use taxation to disempower the powerful or the rich -->

**Georgist**
^[Inspired by the Philosophy of Henry [@George1879]]
I agree there may be something inviolable about owning the value added in free exchange with others.
But, Foundationalist, do you think that should also extend to owning unimproved land and natural resources?
It seems to me that *no one* has really created these values, and whoever reaps rents from them does so *only* because of the coercive powers that be.

Formally speaking and under [dqi]{acronym-label="dqi" acronym-form="singular+short"} coding, both Social Democrat and Georgist refer to Foundationalist's argument, yet their speech acts are of strikingly different quality.
Social Democrat, rather sloppily, reiterates the argument and proceeds to balance it with another good (education) and suggests a compromise.
We can see how the dialogue would proceed;
Foundationalist --- presumably deontologically bound to inviolable property --- would refuse to trade off property against opportunity.
<!-- %FIXME is maybe deontic the correct adjective some of the time? -->
Talking past one another, Social Democrat and Foundationalist may not have exchanged, let alone agreed on universal validity claims.
By contrast, Georgist --- maybe provisionally --- embraces the foundationalist's argument and points to an unexpected implication *in foundationalist* terms.
It is much harder to see how their dialogue would proceed;
presumably, Foundationalist would not --- ex ante --- have been open to large-scale land reform or taxation (as Georgism implies), and may not much warm to the idea.
Still, she may find it necessary to either clarify her position further, or to concede Georgist's point, because his may just be the "forcelessly forceful" better argument.
Foundationalist and Georgist are grappling with the formulations and implications of what *may* become a universally acceptable moral claim, and in so doing, have crept a little closer to communicative rationality.

Crucially, this kind of Habermasian adjudication cannot be done in the abstract;
researchers have to look for ideal speech in *substantive* terms as in this case, a foundationalist theory of property.

By abstracting away the actual arguments from a normative theory vested in their force, these researchers, as @Steiner2012 concedes, "take the position that large parts of the Habermasian version should be relaxed" [@Steiner2012 150].
For @Steiner2012, "the crucial point should be that participants in a political debate acknowledge that others also have reasonable arguments
\[...\]
If this is accomplished, the other side is humanized" [-@Steiner2012 150].
This may well be true and important research, especially for divided societies on which @Steiner2012 here reports, but it stretches the concept of *communicative action* too thin.
<!-- TODO refer to this is the kind of backstop argument for deliberation; it reduces the risk for civil war -->

To be sure, there may be such a loosely-defined thing as "deliberation" --- distinct from "debate"and "discussion" [@Landwehr2010 384] --- and we should study its antecedents and consequences, as much of the above-cited research does.
In this vein, deliberation raises positive questions:
What "middle-range theories" associate antecedents and consequences [@Mutz2008]?
To the extent that this deliberation is a normative project at all, it espouses a *consequentialist* outlook:
deliberation is good, because it leads to "more public-spirited attitudes;
more informed citizens;
greater understanding of sources of, or rationales behind, public disagreements;
a stronger sense of political efficacy;
willingness to compromise;
greater interest in political participation;
and, for some theorists, a binding consensus decision" [@Mutz2008 524].

Habermas prescription for communicative action, again, is different.
<!-- %COMMENT MN aber worüber wird bei H. delibieriert? über normen, nicht über policies -->
<!-- counter here: correct, but the only way to discuss norms in a meaningful way in the modern world is with regard to concrete policies; that's what the world offers us. Aalso, as we'll see, much of the below *is* actually about norms.-->
Communicative action is not a positive statement about causes and effects open to falsification, because it poses a *regulative* principle [@Kant1781], which "is unachievable in its full state, but remains an ideal to which, all else equal, a practice should be judged as approaching more or less closely" [@Mansbridge2010a 80].
Communicative action is also not a consequentialist ethic, but deontological, because "it has the force to legitimate" [@Habermas2008 147] --- or even teleological, because "reaching understanding is the inherent telos of human speech" [@Habermas-1984 287].
As such a normative political theory, communicative action cannot be operationalized into a set of treatments.
Just because you subtract power, inequality, disrespect [@Steenbergen2003], even "irrationality", or any other combination of procedural criteria from communication does not necessarily make it ideal speech --- even though the inverse may well be true, as these and other criteria may be *necessary* conditions for ideal speech.
Legitimating collective choice through ideal speech *is* the irreducible, final reason of @Habermas-1984' political theory whose achievement can only be found in substantive arguments.

Still, to thereby "simply define" deliberation as "intrinsically good" does not, as @Mutz2008 [524] suspects, render "empirical research irrelevant".
As @Steiner2012 [13] reminds us, the "level of deliberation" must be "measured and not merely assumed".
By definition, the normative impetus of communicative action cannot be falsified, but we may find that at any given time, any given people under any given circumstances, *fail* to meet Habermas' exacting standards [@Thompson2008 499].
Such failures can serve "as indicators of *contingent* constraints that deserve serious inquiry and \[...\] as detectors for the discovery of specific causes for existing lacks of legitimacy" (@Habermas2006 [420, emphasis in original], compare also @Thompson2008 [502]).
<!-- %Indeed, empirical researchers ``should focus on those features of the practice that directly relate to the fundamental problem deliberative theory is intended to address: In a state of disagreement, how can citizens reach a collective decision that is legitimate?'' \cite[502]{Thompson2008}. -->

If we accept this more demanding definition of deliberation as the venue in which our approximating of ideal speech is ascertained, as I here wish to do, our research designs must be focused on argumentative substance.
Others have done this, and have produced encouraging insights.
[@Ratner-2008-aa] interviewed [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"} members after the fact, and found that most members considered Habermas' validity claims honored --- especially compared to the proper tragedy that was the following referendum campaign in which many [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"} alumni participated.
While the analysis is based on interviews, not process data, it maintains the Habermasian standard and does not spare the reader qualitative data, including snippets recounting substantive disputes over electoral design.
[@GutmannThompson-2004-aa], too, reporting on deliberations over medical rationing, stick to their (quasi-Habermasian) standard, argumentative reciprocity, and offer examples of how it is met or violated in substantive arguments over health care.

Some may object that this approach collapses the procedural theory of democracy into a substantive theory of justice, and that it consequently requires researchers to take sides.
This neither need, nor ought to be so.
@Habermas-1984' *Communicative Action*, much like @Rawls-1971' contemporary *Theory of Justice* is neither purely procedural, nor substantive, but elegantly posits the *discursive conditions* under which substantive claims ought to be made.
The contrast between procedural and substantive theory, here, as elsewhere, is misleading:

> This kind of public philosophy would avoid the dichotomy that has come to dominate contemporary discussions of political theory, which poses a choice between basing politics on a comprehensive conception of the good, on the one hand, or limiting politics to a conception of procedural justice, on the other.
> We can and should avoid choosing either of these approaches exclusively.
> --- @GutmannThompson-2004-aa [90]

Consequently, researchers need not take sides, nor follow (dubiously legitimate) expert rule [@Blok2007; @Haas1992].
Emphatically, "alternative conceptions of the common good" [@Cohen-1989-aa 23] are possible and desirable.
Researchers must, however, familiarize themselves deeply with the issue to be deliberated, penetrate the discursive fluff and distortions to relentlessly unearth causal and moral disagreements which reasonable people may have over the issue.
Researchers can then analyze their rich, qualitative, ideally process data in terms of these expected disagreements, to assess in how far the observed deliberation lives up to the standards of communicative action.
Ideally, deliberators will struggle to formulate universal validity claims to express and resolve these very disagreements.
In short, researchers need not have a position on the issue, but they *must have a stake* in the abstractions, disagreements and uncertainties plaguing the issue.

Communicative action on taxation, in particular, must be analyzed in substantive terms for these reasons.
Tax is fraught with deep-seated causal and moral disagreement.
To test whether people in any given deliberation on tax really have exchanged universal validity claims to --- potentially --- resolve these disagreements, their actual communication must be compared to some ideal standard of expected arguments, tentatively identified by researchers.

from seligman 20: 20: look again into Buchanan, and relate it to Nagel/murphy the myth of ownership: maybe both looking from the right AND the left, infinite regress ensues – (this is hard to say). TODO actually this is still pretty loose, I think probably think about this in a more careful way. The bottom line would be something like this: buchanan talks about the fiscal illusion, which requires a prior of private property, which is difficult to talk about without reference to the institutions that actually allow private property and commerce. On the other hand, talking about the advantage of public goods only makes sense once you talk about

<!-- % \subsection{Political Psychology}
% Communicative action is very demanding of the cognitive and moral faculties of deliberators.
% Political psychologists have problematized these demands that deliberation poses \citep{Rosenberg-2002-aa} --- especially, but not only, deliberation of highly abstract topics.
% Troublingly for deliberative democracy of the Habermasian kind, recent research in political psychology suggests, that --- contrary to the bounded rationality assumption \citep[for example,][]{Simon-1999-aa,Kahneman2011} --- imperfect human reasoning may not only stem from remediable cognitive scarcity, but may be developmentally determined.
% \citet{Rosenberg-2002-aa} has proposed a threefold developmental sequence and typology of \emph{sequential}, \emph{linear} and \emph{systematic} reasoning.
% %TODO add better rosenberg references
% His empirical accounts suggest that if any, only systematic thinkers will be able to meet the cognitive demands for reasoned arguments, and egalitarian free speech of deliberative democracy.
% Moreover, this cognitive competence was found \emph{not} to be domain specific, and while people may regress to lower levels of competence under high loads or appropriate cues, they are unlikely to easily, if ever, achieve higher than developed levels.
% ``Structurally (more and) less developed reasoning adults'' make ``not only the adequacy of citizens' reasoning, but also their \emph{equality}'' a problem for deliberative democracy \citep[12, emphasis added]{Rosenberg-2007-aa}.

% On this red flag, too, much of deliberative practice is silent.
% While deliberative formats routinely strive to attract diverse participants and ensure their equal participation \citep{Fishkin2009}, they rarely problematize, or measure the substantive, argumentative \emph{equality} of participants.
% Among the small research that has looked into argumentative equality of actual (\gls{dp}) proceedings, \cite{Siu} finds that information, rather than education of participants is related to argument quality \emph{at the small group level}, but offers no individual-level analysis.
% There is also yet --- to my knowledge --- no research that tracks how limited and unequal capacities for moral and causal reasoning may filter up to understandings of, and preferences over complex policy issues.
% Here, too, taxation is a good case to test the promise of deliberative fora:
% it demands both advanced moral and causal reasoning, and raises controversies and tradeoffs likely to impact the life-chances of people along similar socio-economic dimensions as those related to cognitive competence.

% Based on his sobering findings, \citet[20]{Rosenberg-2007-aa} also suggests a revised understanding of deliberation:

% \begin{quotation}
% 	\emph{``Deliberative fora must not be regarded simply as empty stages that provide a venue for the realization of citizenship;
% 	nor must the design of these deliberative stages focus simply on the removal of obstructions that may inhibit freedom or give unequal scope for maneuver.
% 	Instead, deliberation must be understood as a site for the construction and transformation of citizenship.
% 	In deliberation, citizens are made as well as realized.
% 	The operative metaphor here is that of a school, but of particular kind.
% 	The educational goal is not the transmission of specific beliefs and values, although these are by no means irrelevant.
% 	Rather the central aim must be to foster the requisite cognitive development for a fuller autonomy, a greater communicative competence and a better ability to engage in a collaborative effort to make good and just public policy.''}
% 	\\*
% 	--- Shawn W.\ \citet[20]{Rosenberg-2007-aa}
% \end{quotation}

% This ``reforming'' variant of \citeauthor{Habermas-1984}' vision --- informed by empirical facts about our time, and our people --- also bears on the analysis and operationalization of deliberation.
% \emph{School}, as \citeauthor{Rosenberg-2007-aa} reminds us, is the ``operative metaphor'', one that balances furthering of equality and citizens' autonomy.

%note that the link between rosenbergs sequence thinking and my tax misunderstandings is still to be developed -->


### Misunderstanding Taxation

Survey and experimental researchers have investigated how people misunderstand taxation and its abstractions.
[@McCafferyBaron2003], tracking the heuristics and biases research program [@KahnemanEtAl1982] suggest that voters fall short of @VonNeumannMorgenstern1944-rationality in their choice of tax:
they incorrectly believe that taxation has a trivial, "flypaper" incidence [@McCafferyBaron2004b], they favor (indirect) taxes not labeled or not visible, they fail to aggregate different taxes --- especially the proportional or regressive [payroll]{acronym-label="payroll" acronym-form="singular+short"} and [vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- confuse progression in absolute and percentage terms and inconsistently prefer bonuses over penalties.
Worried, [@McCafferyBaron2004] suspect that politicians may exploit these and other misunderstandings and that current tax systems may be suboptimal as a result of voter irrationality.
They also suggest that people may overestimate effective progression, and that tax regimes may, as a result, be less redistributive than voters intend and believe them to be [@McCafferyBaron2004].

In a similar vein, [@SausgruberTyran2011] show that people mistake the nominal incidence of a tax with its effective incidence on the buyers and sellers in a taxed market transaction.[^always_markets]

[^always_markets]: By definition, taxes in a market economy --- a pleonasm --- must *always* be levied as some potential market exchange occurs.
    This is straightforward for income and consumption taxes, where the earning and spending transactions are taxed, but also holds for wealth taxes and even other instruments of expropriation (such as inflation).
    Taxation always requires some real (or imputed) market valuation of the given tax base, which in turn necessitates an actual or hypothetical transaction between market participants.
<!-- %add reference to liquidity effects -->
In their laboratory experiment, participant buyers frequently tax sellers more than themselves, forgetting that --- under perfect competition, especially factor rent and price flexibility --- buyers and sellers will share any given tax on their transaction irrespective of the nominal incidence.[^tax-lse]

[^tax-lse]: This according to the [tax-lse]{acronym-label="tax-lse" acronym-form="singular+short"}.
<!-- %add reference to perfect competition conditions -->

Under the resulting "tax-shifting bias" [@SausgruberTyran2011], or, equivalently "flypaper theory of taxation" [@McCafferyBaron2003], participant buyers often choose suboptimally high taxes on sellers, which they end up paying (partly) themselves.
@SausgruberTyran2011 furthermore find that participants are less likely to tax-shift if they are given accurate information on tax burdens exogenously and if they have experienced its income-reducing effects in the laboratory marketplace.
Troublingly for deliberative democrats, they also find that (albeit minimally defined) initial deliberation does not reduce tax-shifting, but that it "makes initially held opinions more extreme rather than correct" [-@SausgruberTyran2011 164], corroborating concerns for (deliberative) group polarization [@Sunstein1991].

These are rigorously researched and disconcerting findings that have not received nearly the attention they deserve from welfare state scholars and other political economists.
These and other misunderstandings of tax may constitute partial, possibly sufficient --- but not necessary --- causes for changing tax regimes and constricted, or retrenched welfare states.
<!-- %note the absence of arbitrage mechanisms -->

These are also --- much like the sponsoring heuristics and biases program --- no definitive, comprehensive list of misunderstandings, but an evolving, loosely connected set of relatively low-level cognitive effects.
More research is needed:

-   how do people (mis)understand some of the broader and more complex issues bearing on taxation, such as economic growth, savings rates or government and market failures?
-   how --- if at all --- do the suggested low-level cognitive heuristics and biases filter up to the very structured choices of base, schedule and timing of taxation asked of the [oecd]{acronym-label="oecd" acronym-form="singular+short"} polities?

As these pressing questions are addressed to develop a coherent account of social change from misunderstanding taxation, research
designs as those by @McCafferyBaron2004 or @SausgruberTyran2011 may well face two kinds of limits:

1.  The complexity of higher-order considerations may overwhelm both designs.

    Laboratory models in behavioral economics as those by @SausgruberTyran2011 have the distinct advantage of directly testing the misunderstood causal effect in question (in this case, [tax-lse]{acronym-label="tax-lse" acronym-form="singular+short"}), and rendering participants with an immediate experience of the effect (here, lower incomes).
    As the causal effects in question become more complex --- for example, liquidity or employment decisions under different taxes --- laboratory models face ever harsher tradeoffs between internal and external validity [for a review and dissenting opinion, see @Jimenez-Buedo2010].
    Trivially, economy-wide choices --- for example, between a [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} and [pct]{acronym-label="pct" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- are very hard to model in the laboratory;
    if they were any easier, economic policy would be a non-issue.

    The within-subject designs of cognitive psychology as those by @McCafferyBaron2004 also offer great internal validity when the heuristics and biases are low-level.
    Participants rate their agreement with, or the truth, of several statements they are presented with.
    Experimenters vary the context or wording of substantively identical statements to identify contradictions or mental shortcuts within the answers of individual participants.
    @McCafferyBaron2004 provide supposedly "de-biasing" information as within-subject treatments.
    The problem with higher-level concerns --- say, whether to tax income or consumption --- is that equivalent de-biasing treatments would eventually need to be an introductory economics course, covering at least the circular flow in the economy, some macroeconomics of aggregate demand and the Haig-Simons identity of income.
    As the required syllabus grows, it not only becomes impractical for participants with limited time and patience, but it also ignites a combinatorial explosion of necessary treatments to figure out just which (of supposedly many) insights from the de-biasing did the trick.

2.  More problematically yet for the deliberative-minded researcher, both designs cannot problematize, let alone resolve, any *remaining* substantive disagreements over taxation and its economic abstractions.
    Both behavioral economics and cognitive psychology stipulate that there is *a* ([vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-)rationality, and merely chronicle whatever human deviations from it they find.
    Again as with the heuristics and biases research program in general, researchers and deciders must be aware of these deviations from rationality in tax, but these deviations do not add up to a theory, much less an account of social change in taxation or democracy.
    We know that @VonNeumannMorgenstern1944 say one (internally consistent) thing, and other homo sapiens mostly something else, but we learn little about the conditions of this divergence, let alone ways to reconcile it.

    Things get even thornier for a heuristics and biases research program of tax, when higher-level concerns are introduced and --- as they likely will --- turn out to be controversial.
    @McCafferyBaron2004 or @SausgruberTyran2011 posit expert rationality against their participants, and, whenever they differ, find their participants at fault.
    This works well enough for disentangling percentage and absolute tax burdens, and tolerably for demonstrating a tax-shifting bias[^flexible_prices],
    but leaves the researcher empty-handed when faced with genuine disagreement *between* experts, or challenges as the legitimacy of expertise.
    To be sure, there *may* well be *the* [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-rational, human-nature-compatible optimal taxation, that renders all other proposals regrettable misunderstandings --- but this hypothesized agreement and its communicative conditions must be tested, not axiomatized.
    The heuristics and biases research program can inspire a sociological account of misunderstood taxation, but it cannot bring it to its conclusion.
    When faced with inevitably controversial higher-level issues such as the choice between a [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} and a [pct]{acronym-label="pct" acronym-form="singular+short"}, both cognitive psychology and behavioral economics will smack of expertocracy and remain fruitless because they allow no recourse to a second-order theory [@GutmannThompson-2004-aa 125] --- such as Habermasian deliberation --- to resolve disagreement.

[^flexible_prices]: Tellingly, @SausgruberTyran2011 already take pains to remind readers that [tax-lse]{acronym-label="tax-lse" acronym-form="singular+short"} only holds when factor rents and prices are fully flexible --- a condition that is as controversial as is it is difficult to verify, even after 60 years of macroeconomic debate about little else [@Wapshott2011].

The deliberative experiments on taxation proposed here builds on these two strands of research as much as it probes its limits:

1.  A deliberative forum on taxation, including its structured choices and abstractions, adds another --- yet rare --- experiment on a technocratic and complex policy issue to the empirical record.
    From this perspective, deliberation is the research topic, and taxation is a *case* to test the limits and capacities of this prescription for political *rule*.
    [^tax_franzi]

    <!-- % \item The proposed deliberation on tax also generates new insights into the cognitive demands of communicative action.
    % It asks people with likely limited, and socially structur\emph{ed}, unequal abilities for causal and moral reasoning to deliberate the demanding issues of taxation, which are, in turn, socially structur\emph{ing}.
    % From this perspective, the research topic is the (re)production of social and political inequality under liberalism.
    % Deliberation is the ideal-typical operationalization of political autonomy promised by liberalism, and taxation the quintessential institution for social justice allowed by liberalism.
    % %add some quote from Rosenberg -->

2.  Lastly, deliberating taxation will provide data to better understand possible misunderstandings of tax and, thereby, clarify remaining controversies over it.
    From this perspective, optimal taxation and popular deviations therefrom are the research topic, and deliberation provides the *method* to investigate, or even resolve these differences in a normatively attractive manner [@Rawls-1971; @Habermas-1984].
    
<!-- %add visualization of the above and below paragraph? -->

These three research topics all fold into the aforementioned research question:
how will different people understand taxation differently, if they participate in a deliberative process *closer* to the ideals of communicative action than the status quo of representative democracy?

[^tax_franzi]: Taxation is a good case, because --- as Franziska Deutsch succinctly noted in 2011 --- it affects everyone, but most people know little about it.


### Desiderata

Before specifying a format to investigate this question, I must note some of the substantive desiderata of deliberation and taxation that any operationalization will have to reflect, if it is to maintain construct validity.

#### Taxation

Taxation offers highly structured choices along the three dimensions of base, schedule and timing, the first two of which are cross-tabulated in table.
<!-- TODO refer to tax overview table here -->
There can be no meaningful democratic rule on taxation that does not ultimately opt for a definitive mix of distinct combinations along those dimensions.
The choice among these (already high-level) alternatives cannot be abstracted away, or relegated to experts:
it hinges on irreducible moral and causal judgments [for example, @McCaffery2005].
Upon arrival, participants will be greeted by the convener and asked to fill out a questionnaire, including simply worded questions about their desired tax base and schedule.

For example, some items might read:

> How much, on a scale from 1--5 do you agree with the following statements?
>
> 1.  People should pay taxes as a percentage of what they earn, both from their work and their investments, including such things as rents, dividends and interest.
>
> 2.  People should pay taxes as a percentage of what they consume, or 'use up', including such items as food, private cars or haircuts.
>     They should not be taxed on things they buy as investments or that do not get used up quickly, including such items as a house, a computer for work or a share in a company.
>
> 3.  People should pay taxes as a percentage of what they own subtracted from their debts, including their houses (minus the mortgage), their cash (minus their overdraft loan) or their companies.
>
Taken together, these items in the questionnaires will "map" participants on the possible tax choices summarized in the above table.
<!-- TODO insert link to tab tax-overview  -->
The questionnaire will also illicit some socio-economic variables, broader attitudes *towards*, as well as knowledge *about* taxation and a self-assessment of autonomy and competence on these matters.

After filling out the questionnaire, the topic of the deliberation will be introduced by two moderators, both of which are non-experts in the field.
The moderators again introduce a simplified version of the above table, and walk participants through the combinations of base and schedule --- including presently used [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"}, [vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"} and [payroll]{acronym-label="payroll" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- but abstain from causal, or normative statements about these taxes.
The table will also be prominently displayed on premise for easy reference by participants.
Participants are then tasked to deliberate the basic choices of base and schedule.

Deliberation alternates throughout the day between small-group settings of 5--8 persons and larger plenary sessions.
Moderators assist the participants and encourage the norms of deliberation --- including respect, equal participation and argumentative reciprocity --- but do not clarify or comment on substantive questions.
Moderators also make sure that no pressure for a collective decision is exerted.
Participants are invited to collect questions for a question and answer session held mid-day with a balanced panel of economic experts.
The deliberation concludes in a plenary session where participants are invited to reflect on the experience, as well as to identify further questions for deliberation.
Participants fill out a questionnaire again, including some of the questions from the initial questionnaire, as well as some additional items concentrating on the deliberative experience, especially the perceived autonomy, equality and competence of participants.
are recompensed for their time and thanked by the convener.

If their democratic rule is to be enlightened, deliberators must also engage a set of abstractions concerning its optimality, justice and sustainability as well as problematize the view of human motivation, utility and rationality implied by these (economic) abstractions.
<!-- TODO link to old tax sections in the above -->
Deliberators must also understand the means and ends of an (ideal) mixed economy within which taxation reconciles allocation by plan and by exchange, including respective government and market failures.
@Warren2008 [K1513], reporting on the [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"}, notes that such learning phases are "crucial to its ability to render a decision, and indeed" and that it *can be done*:
"the decision was a learned and sophisticated one";
"Most members transformed themselves from lay citizens with little knowledge of electoral systems into experts over a period of several months (...)" [-@Warren2008 K1513].
Any deliberation that fails to engage such technical but broadly consensual --- if not entirely coherent --- concerns, must be considered unenlightened.
It would ignore some of the causal relationships and moral alternatives that we must assume exist, if and to the extent that we accept the economic ontology of coexisting states and markets.
<!-- TODO link to mixed econony and ontology -->


#### Deliberation

Deliberation is no such catalogue of first-order considerations of what would make a good (efficient, fair, sustainable) decision in any given policy field, but instead, a second-order prescription to resolve disagreement *over* those very the moral and causal arguments [@GutmannThompson-2004-aa 125].
Still, and in contrast to pluralism, it places more than just *procedural* claims, but posits *substantive* requirements for how agreement must be reached.
Succinctly, @GutmannThompson-2004-aa demand that "your fellow citizens must give reasons that are comprehensible to you" [-@GutmannThompson-2004-aa K177].
More than merely intelligible, permissible arguments to reach deliberative agreement must raise validity [@Habermas-1984] and moral [@Rawls-1971] claims *universally* acceptable to everyone.

Logically, it must then be theoretically possible for any *given* argument to *fail* that test, and to be impermissible --- including the arguments brought forward by experts.
In fact, deliberation reserves no special place for nominal experts at all, except if and to the extent that these experts have arrived at, and present their agreement under the standards of deliberation.

As noted in the above, any research design that axiomatizes any disagreement between experts (or ex-ante logic) as *misunderstandings* on the part of the non-experts fails the deliberative standard, no matter the supposedly enlightening de-biasing treatments.


#### Reciprocity

The desiderata of taxation and deliberation are seemingly in conflict.
Taxation requires people to consider an exogenously given catalogue of abstractions, and deliberation implies that no such set of arguments can be unconditionally accepted.
This is a general contradiction of procedural and substantively epistemic formulations of deliberative democracy [@Bohman1998 402].

This impasse has real repercussions for the proposed research design:
apparently, it can serve only one master.
Either, participants misunderstandings can be revealed by treating them with introductory economics, *or* they can deliberate any which arguments they themselves find comprehensible.

As with so much that deliberative theory is up against this is a false dichotomy.[^false_dichotomies]

[^false_dichotomies]: For example, political participation versus enlightened understanding versus political equality, as @Fishkin2009 points out.

Argumentative reciprocity implies that expert knowledge be neither presumed, nor negated, but that these arguments --- as all others --- be allowed to demonstrate their universal causal and moral validity.

<!-- %``Mutual justification means not merely offering reasons to other people, or even offering reasons that they happen to accept [\ldots] \citep[98]{GutmannThompson-2004-aa}.
%	It means providing reasons that constitute a justification for imposing binding laws on them.
%	What reasons count as such a justification is inescapably a substantive question.
%	Merely formal standards for mutual justification --- such as a requirement that maxims implied by laws be generalizable --- are not sufficient.%plagiarism? -->

Expert- and non-expert (as all other) arguments must not merely be balanced in terms of airtime or affect, but "the considerations offered in favor of, or against, a proposal, candidate or policy \[must\] be answered in a substantive way by *those who advocate a different position*" [@Fishkin2009 K550, emphasis added].
Deliberation is, in other words, when non-experts answer expert arguments *on their own, expert terms*, and vice versa, too.
Surely, the relation of this ideal to practice is "aspirational", too, as all in deliberation [@Fishkin2009 K2679].
So far, democratic theorists have failed to show "how to incorporate the need for expertise and technical administration in a deliberative democracy" [@Thompson2008 515] and "\[a\] great deal of work on deliberative theory focuses on conflicting values, religious toleration, identities and so on, and relatively little on conflicting facts" [@Moore2011 2].

Yet, for the deliberative experimenter, this aspiration to argumentative reciprocity is the ultimate hypothesis in need of falsification, including reciprocity with expert arguments.
If expert knowledge on taxation is presumed valid, and any dissent chalked up as misunderstandings the aspiration of communicative action could *never* be falsified.
Likewise, if expert knowledge on taxation is not given adequate opportunity to be reciprocally considered on its own terms, communicative action will *always* be violated.
Neither of those formats would provide construct-valid deliberation.
Expert knowledge is then "a special case of the general problem of convincing those who are not 'in the room' to accept the results of a deliberation in which they did not directly participate" [@Moore2011 2].
This problem can only be resolved by a "democratic conception of expert authority" [@Moore2011 2], that is, if deliberative standards are extended to expert arguments, too.
A good deliberative format brings ordinary citizens into this business:
they must be enabled to the farthest extent possible to argue expert as well as non-expert claims on their own terms, including the possibility to reject expert opinion if it is found insufficiently reciprocal in argument.

Because bringing ordinary citizens into this business, and *equally* so, is, as @Rosenberg-2002-aa's so difficult, deliberations must "be regarded as remedial institutions" [-@Rosenberg-2007-aa 12] and more, "they must be sites for political education and development" [-@Rosenberg-2007-aa 13].


### Format

Consequently, a good format for deliberating tax includes a strong learning component, where participants are introduced to the structured choices and relevant abstractions suggested by experts, including their disagreements, conditions and uncertainties.
Deliberators are unlikely to cover these extensive grounds by themselves, or pick them up from (very limited) briefing books and will benefit from well-planned lessons.
On the other hand, a good format must also feature extensive small-group discussion, where participants talk amongst themselves, shielded from the authority of expertise.
Deliberators may benefit from a trained, non-expert moderator and/or scribe to assist, structure and document their discussion.
Most importantly, participants must be encouraged to adjudicate the validity claims of economics, to contrast and possibly relate those to their own, and other claims.

As noted earlier, most deliberative formats include --- often moderated --- small-group discussion, but few add to that a substantive learning component.[^dps]

[^dps]: [dps]{acronym-label="dp" acronym-form="plural+short"}, the pronounced methodological gold standard of deliberation [@Mansbridge2010] are too short to feature long lessons, and confine expert knowledge to ad-hoc question and answer sessions with experts and limited briefing books [@Fishkin2009].
    Citizen Juries [@SmithWales-2000-aa], Planning Cells [@Dienel-1999-aa] and related formats also include no learning components, and some experimenters even advise against expert knowledge.

Among those that do are the small-n Danish-developed Consensus Conferences [@Grundahl1995] and especially the large-n, one-off [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"} in British Columbia, Canada [@Citizen-2004-aa].
Consensus Conferences have been held on very technical issues, including nanotechnology [@LeeKleinman2007] or genetically modified foods, and the Citizen Assembly was tasked to recommend an alternative electoral system for the province.
Much like taxation, technology policy, and especially electoral systems design also demand highly structured choices (for example, a seat allocation rule or regulation) and raises a set of abstractions (party systems or risk distributions).

In a Consensus Conference, 12-15 self-selected but diverse citizens discuss a technical matter of political relevance for three or more days (!) and issue a report on their discussions [@LeeKleinman2007].
In preparation for the conference, participants read quite extensive background material, which they discuss during the first of several daylong sessions.
At later sessions, they (publicly) share their questions with experts and finally draft a report for the sponsoring body and/or the media.
@LeeKleinman2007 report that a positive atmosphere, good organization and skillful facilitation are necessary for a successful Consensus Conference.
They also recommend that participants tell their stories, which moderators then weave into themes, to help citizens relate their experiences to expert knowledge [-@LeeKleinman2007 159].

The [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"} expanded on this model.
Over the course of a year, 160 randomly selected British Columbians read and learned about electoral systems, held public hearings, deliberated amongst themselves and, after several intermediate votes, recommended a (quite complicated) [stv]{acronym-label="stv" acronym-form="singular+short"}-variant and drafted a report [@Citizen-2004-aa].
The extensive learning phase, spanning six (!) weekends stands out among deliberative experiments.
In addition to a university-level textbook on electoral systems, Citizens received interactive lectures accompanied by small discussion groups.
An expert panel vetted the learning phase for impartiality and accuracy of information.
Participants also developed a set of shared values during the learning phase, both (procedurally) for how they wished to deliberate and (substantively) for a desirable electoral system.


### Implementation

The [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"} provides an ideal blueprint for a deliberative forum on tax;
however, limited resources and lack of experience do not permit such a large undertaking for this project.

Instead, the project proposed here is a scaled-down hybrid, combining the ambitious learning phases of a Citizen Assembly, with the more intimate, small-n interaction and participant empowerment of Consensus Conferences.[^learning_phase_ca]

[^learning_phase_ca]: The [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"} also featured a "listening phase" [@Pearse2008 1609] during which members held public hearings throughout the province, drawing some 3,000 attendees and 1,600 written submissions.
    Both because I do not have the resources and --- absent a mandate --- expect limited public interest, I plan no such phase.

A small, self-selected sample of 15-24 diverse, ideally randomly-sampled, citizens will attend around 6 days of learning and deliberation spread over several weeks.
A provisional schedule is included in (p. ).

After introducing the format and framing the issue, deliberators are invited to tell stories about experiences with taxation, following @Mansbridge2010a [67]'s recommendation:
'Stories can establish credibility, create empathy, and trigger a sense of injustice, all of which contribute directly or indirectly to justification'' [-@Mansbridge2010a 67].
Deliberators also share opinions and grievances about tax as well as identify relevant questions and issues, which will be taken up in, and structure the later learning phases.
During these learning sessions, taking up less than half of the time, participants receive information about the structured choices and relevant abstractions of taxation from the author.
These lessons are organized around themes and values identified by deliberators in an initial session, and attempt to relate the subject matter to participant experiences.
Learning sessions alternate with extensive small-group deliberations, during which participants reflect on the lessons, relate or contrast it to their own experiences and claims and adjudicate the validity of the presented moral and causal arguments.
Small-group deliberations are facilitated by a trained moderator, who has no expertise in taxation or economics.
At the end of the process, participants must agree on a tax and write a report outlining their recommendation, which can be released to the public.
If resources permit, participants will also hear a panel of expert witnesses to discuss their questions.

## Research Design

<!-- %see below
%cases, people, selection
%methods of observation and/or inference -->

### Hypotheses

The threefold research question raises several hypotheses:

#### Quantitative Data

Both research questions, about 1) the remaining disagreements about tax and 2) the ability of deliberative democracy to cover abstract and structured issues can be rolled up into one set of hypotheses.

@Fishkin2009 suggests that deliberation increases knowledge, and changes preferences as a function of such knowledge gain.
Similarly, I hypothesize that people will gain in knowledge about taxation, including resolving some systematic misunderstandings of concepts and causal relationships, some variants of which are already documented [@McCafferyBaron2003; @Caplan2007].
I furthermore hypothesize that *as a function* of these knowledge gains, people will change their preferences on the desired base and schedule of taxation.
Additionally, deliberation will increase self-assessed autonomy and competence of participants, and they will find the presented alternatives of base and schedule more meaningful.
Learning interventions will further drive knowledge gain and improve self-assessments, but --- if it is sufficiently balanced --- *will not* interact with attitude change.

### Data and Methods

To clearly measure the hypothesized $\Delta$ in knowledge and preferences, but also to verify argumentative reciprocity and to directly observe (or problematize) communicative action, this project will utilize both survey and process data.

Akin to the [dp]{acronym-label="dp" acronym-form="singular+short"}s, participants will be asked to respond to closed- and open-ended survey questions on tax issues, both before and after the forum.
The surveys will also gather basic socio-economic data and invite feedback on the deliberative forum itself.
This data can be compared before and after the deliberative treatment within-subjects.
Lacking a sufficiently large sample, in lieu of quantitative analysis of closed-ended questions, responses to open-ended questions will be qualitatively coded and compared with the hypothesized (mis)understandings.

Additionally, process data from the deliberation will be gathered, comprising of the claims, themes and questions raised by participants and summarized by the moderator and/or scribe at the end of each deliberation, as well as the final report on taxation and other documents or notes produced during the deliberation.
Deliberations will also be audio-(visually) recorded, although comprehensive transcription and analysis of this data will probably not be possible.
This process data and select recordings will then be subjected to a qualitative content analysis, both to verify that participants *could* make arguments reciprocally comprehensible (and otherwise valid), and to record which of several arguments deliberators accepted as based on universal validity claims.


## Feasibility

This project is theoretically, methodologically and organizationally demanding, but it can be completed in about 2 years.
In my prior work on the mixed economy and taxation, I have already distilled a compact set of abstractions and choices to be considered by deliberators.
Existing chapters ([\[chap:wanted\]](#chap:wanted){reference-type="ref" reference="chap:wanted"}--[\[chap:better-tax\]](#chap:better-tax){reference-type="ref" reference="chap:better-tax"}, p. ff.) provide a good basis for the briefing material, learning phases, questionnaire development and qualitative analyses.
Happily, these chapters abstract away much of the political controversy over economic issues, clearly state remaining expert dissent and, rather than definitive answers, present a catalogue of questions, tradeoffs and clarifications.
Prior work and derived material should hopefully be roughly consensual amongst experts, and thoroughly balanced.
Still, additional vetting and advice from a panel of academic economists will be required, especially because my highly selective training is mostly auto-didactic.

While I have some experience teaching introductory classes on political economy, ensuring the deliberative autonomy of participants will be a challenge.
The fora, even though featuring learning phases, must not regress to a (traditional) classroom setting in which the economics teacher knows best.
Still, this *is* the inescapable challenge of deliberation in the modern world, as @Moore2011 points out:
"the ideal of citizen equality to deliberate issues that affect them is in tension with the inequalities of knowledge that are inherently governing complex societies", *but* "the question is not *whether* expert authority is part of the deliberative system, but *how* it is integrated and whether *this integration is itself subject to deliberative standards*" [@Moore2011 14, emphasis added].

Because I have no practical experience with deliberative formats, ensuring conditions for genuine communicative action will be hard:
'the potential for abuse \[by facilitators\] is real, and crafting an appropriate conceptual and institutional response will be difficult'' [@GutmannThompson-2004-aa 25].
Together with the moderator and/or scribe, the forum must be meticulously planned and discussed with experienced organizers.
Ideally, I should attend a deliberative experiment to gain some first-hand impressions.

Moreover, participant acquisition and sample attrition will likely pose problems, requiring early planning and concerted outreach to local organizations and leaders.

Lastly, data gathering and analysis may easily outmatch available resources.
I must filter data and focus the analysis on a manageable size.


## Payoff

This is probably an unconventional, and possibly risky project, but it has promise, too.

If, given the right design, deliberative democracy can enable citizens to rule on complex issues, political scientists will have a very able, and attractive hypothetical to compare with, and deliberative experimenters should have more courage to venture out to more topics facing our sovereigns.
Not just as social scientists, but as citizens too, we must know whether the once historical achievement of aggregative democracy is now withering away under the assault of tightly concentrated special interest and obscuring complexity.
If it can show its stripes, deliberative democracy may well be our last, and also our best hope, to reveal the perils of pluralism, then to live up to our greater capacity for communicative action.

If, even under the brand of liberal democracy most demanding of political autonomy, people of lower cognitive ability or socio-economic status were to misunderstand taxation, be unable to engage in reciprocally comprehensible argument and as a result, opt for taxes against their material interest, social inequality research would face a whole new process of perpetuating privilege.
Not only as social scientists, but as citizens, too, we must know how no one gets left behind in our schools of democracy [@DeTocqueville1840; @Rosenberg-2002-aa].
Liberal democracy, at bottom, requires that political participation *can* be made autonomous from power, status and wealth, and on this condition hinges the feasibility of liberalism as a political philosophy [@GutmannThompson-2004-aa K1431].

If, under a normatively more attractive democratic process, people were to resolve some misunderstandings about, and agree on different, but doable and desirable taxes, welfare state research and political economy would have to explain a much greater retrenchment and democratic failure.
Not only as social scientists, but as citizens, too, we must know that better tax we could agree on, and if it exists, what is keeping us from it.
Taxation, underneath it all, *is* the social contract [@SchumpeterSwedberg-1942-aa], and its vitality will determine the prospects for modern progress.

How, ask wryly @PrzeworskiSalomon1995 [2], will we ever know that such grandiose conclusions are valid?

Here, the project turns full circle, and back to reciprocity.
We will know that these conclusions are valid, if at every point along the way --- theory, operationalization, sampling, measurement and analysis --- I have provided causal and moral arguments that are universally acceptable.

I have provided reasons in this proposal;
I hope they are comprehensible to my readers --- and especially to my supervisors.
Now, we must adjudicate their universal validity on their own terms.
With any luck, the [bigsss]{acronym-label="bigsss" acronym-form="singular+short"} will still be a place where such communicative action happens.

### Schumpeter 1918

- reads like today!
- cite SChumpeter: the confusion and non-scientific/ideological nature seems very interesting, p. 99
- 103: argues that once there is a state, *anything* could be a matter for the public; now I am not so sure, there are still economic considerations (economies of scale, etc.)
- 104: that's a good thought – it's ahistorical to think of previous times as hyper-private, without the state – because this *functional differentiation* simply had not happened yet.
- 105: that's a good point: that the crisis must be fundamental, related to the foundational logic – maybe we have that today with the dual crises of the welfare state
- 108: such a great notion how the democracies are saddled with the old baggage of feudalism! It was the princes state that was assimiliated (as far as possible by democracies)
- notice that this 108ff schumpeter makes the same argument as could be made about post-communist welfare states: they *were no* welfare *states* under socialism, because the economy and state were *one* undifferentiated realm
- 114: not sure how we can practically have a monopoly tax, but some things work out great – the land value tax! Schumpeter also recommends it!
- 116: fantastic keynes-esque quote on the end of history in tax
- 124: the whole war debt thing is a bit of magical thinking ...
- 131: more keynesian optimism on the future end of history

Comment: Schumpeter might really be thinking about the laffer curve: past regime does not work because costs of extraction are prehibivey,  so you need a new system.
In away, schumpeter really thinks AS WE MUSt of tax state as interfacing the mixed economy.


### Buchanan 1967

TODO Cite Buchanan on fiscal illusion in diss, and the italians he cites, seems quite similar.

- hereagain the myth of ownership strikes hard: it is VERY hard to price the "real" cost of public goods, almost circularly.
- either way, infinite regress ensues.
- i'd like to hear him argue against the LVT or PCT
- I agree with much of this: financial transaction tax really is a tax that's widely loved because no one knows who pays it.

Look back into Macomber, what the ruling says, maybe get back to Ajay (it seems that Macomber did *not* introduce realisation-based evaluation).


- We should do relate this to social/epistemic/individual preferences *explicitly* (if we can)
- We should explicate the external validity (real world?), increase the complexity (effort, capital)
- We should try and relate this to Kahnemann/Tversky research program.
- [Lucy Barnes](https://www.kent.ac.uk/politics/staff/canterbury/barnes.html) was quite interested in this stuff


> relate to Kahnemann/Tversky work on bounded rationality: which behavioral biases work here?

It's not clear to me how these biases translate to more complex tax scenarios.
McCaffery and Baron have tried this, but only on very, very simple models.
Loss Aversion probably plays a role.


- deliberation IS used more often on taxation, says Caroline lee: post 2008, there IS stuff on retrenchment
- public engagement profs: raising people's tax morale
- 2 issues: it's better to be remote from the state // it's better to open up questions

- Re-read nina eliasoph: conflict out

- Nina Eliasoph, 
- Chantal Mouffe
- intellectually coward, self-congratulatory

really add this as a completely new reason for my diss: the concern that deliberation might be watered down, professionalized to the degree where it becomes just marketing.

My answer out of that is actually - counterintuitively -- longer, deeper, learning.

actually this is a somewhat fundamental addition: it's not just "facilitating dialogue" (whoch is what deliberation seems to degenerate into) – we need "didactiv reduction"; again the schools for democracy goes quite deep here.

I have a reference to abortion somewhere, that it CANNOT be resolved and there seems to be a case from Caroline Lee where pro-life and pro-choice people got together and talked with one another to prevent violence, and they ended up liking one another, but *not* agreeing at all
this is interesting both because of of the moral issue of abortion, but also as an example of the talk


# why don't we have a better tax?

also look at the plots I have on this; why, really?
what are alternative explanations?


# As if economics

Milton Friedman argued that for economic models is does not matter whether assumptions are realistic, or whether actors understand them – but whether predictions are borne out, and whether actors behave *as if they had some given theory in mind*.
An instructive example for this would be a billard player who does not know the laws of physics in any case, but behaves *as if* s/he understood them.
This is the example from Friedman.

Paul Pfleiderer via Econtalk on Russ Ruberts points out that this depends on *continuous* and *instantaneous* feedback – so these are repetetitive games, with quick feedback.
So something like the 10k hours rules might apply.
Paul Pfleider then applies this to capital structure decisions by firms – a lot of research on this.
How do firms decide this?
The problem that we have is that very similar firms objectively have very different capital structures, and we don't know why.
So the solutions suggested by economists are incredibly complex – but there's a catch: CEOs make very few capital structure decisions, and they don't get immediate feedback (none).
So the 10k hour learning kind of rule does not at all apply.

... so I need to make some kind of pragmatic argument out of this.

# Habermas Ach Europa
so clearly, we want only a notion of a plausible *possibility* of rational solutions, we don't want to look just at rational solutions (first vs second order).
However, you can't just defer this to process; that would be insufficient, and turn full circle. A deliberation is good if it makes rational solutions plausible, and solutions are plausible if they result from good deliberation. Discuss the different operationalizations about this, including DQI.
So what we need, is some kind of standard that is not procedural, but also not substantive, but in-between, kinda like  Rawls. But we don't have that ideal position (but we might approximate it?)

The question now is: can Q-method, or intersubjective rationality and meta-consensus *be* this thing, and if so, why.

Need to look in to the whole concourse theory thing

Q Methodology, maybe via its quantum theoretic reading (it's about viewpoints, and there exist no objective statements (like zero energy atom states) outside of it -- that's not soo far from discourse theory.
	on this see especially Wendy S. Rogers in operating subjectivity; she argues it is and/or can be used as a form of discourse analysis.

FIXME I might have the difference between constructivism and constructionism wrong in my thesis, especially when citing Berger/Luckmann which seem to be the former and Foucault which is the latter. Constructionism may be the social variant. 

Write to McCafferys co-author about q, since he is a psychologist and also does quant stuff.

Somehow the stuff that happens during deliberation is actually quite close to some of the stuff that q methodologists rights and that stephenson assumed; it's in expressing and exchanging views vis-a-vis subjects. Both approaches negate that there's stuff "in the braiN" that just need be extracted.

### Hemerijck

> "I like to believe that history is smarter than I am." (Hemerijck, December 10, 2010)

really?!? I think path dependency is part of the answer why history errs in this case. Before individual (let alone electronic) checking and savings accounts, only an income tax was feasible to achieve some degree of progression. Individual Haig-Simons accounts were simply not available for a large share of the population. In addition, the income tax was, at that point, a powerful tool to get at the supramarginal returns of a capital-owning class. Today, the income tax, or some defunct version of it lingers on for reasons of path dependency. A PCT, indeed, cannot easily co-exist with an income tax.

deliberative democracy is the opposite to economic theories of democracy


# Trivilization of democracy

They slice and dice the electorate.

Look at the US to see what's coming up.

Kahnemann/Tversky. The Myth of the Rational Voter.


Liberal, representative democracy, rests on a pluralist theory of governance (Louw 2005:15). Pluralism, being both empirical hypothesis and normative prescription supposes that political power is, and should be widely dispersed among society’s interest groups. These interest groups, made up of ever active citizens, openly compete with one another, thereby preventing any one of them to become a dominant elite.

# parties on Taxes
# FDP

11: Unser Ziel bleibt die Entlastung der arbeitenden Mitte. Eine höhere Steuerbelastung für Bürger und Unternehmen lehnen wir entschieden ab. Hohe Steuersätze führen nicht auto- matisch zu höheren Staatseinnahmen, sondern verhindern Wachstum, vernichten Arbeits- plätze und gefährden damit die Existenz zahlloser Arbeitnehmer und ihrer Familien.

11: Wir sehen nach wie vor die Notwendigkeit einer grundlegenden Reform des Einkommen- und des Unternehmensteuerrechts. Dabei setzen wir auf ein einfaches, niedriges und ge- rechtes Steuersystem mit moderaten Sätzen und wenigen Ausnahmen – idealerweise in einem Stufentarif.

13: Die Unternehmensteuer muss wachstumsfreundlich modernisiert werden. Dazu wollen wir sie möglichst rechtsform- und finanzierungsneutral ausgestalten und für kleine und mittle- re GmbHs die so genannte transparente Besteuerung einführen. Danach könnten sich klei- ne und mittelständische GmbHs vergleichbar mit Personenunternehmen besteuern lassen. Bei der Konzernbesteuerung brauchen wir ein wettbewerbsfähiges Gruppenbesteuerungs- recht nach österreichischem Vorbild. Umwandlungen innerhalb des Konzerns dürfen weder der Ertrag- noch der Grunderwerbsteuer unterworfen werden.

14: Um die Eigenkapitalbildung in Personengesellschaften zu erleichtern, die nach der Ein- kommensteuer veranlagt werden, wollen wir eine steuermindernde Eigenkapitalverzinsung umsetzen, wie sie in anderen europäischen Ländern bereits erfolgreich verwirklicht wird. Alle Aufwendungen, die durch den Betrieb veranlasst wurden, sollen auch in Zukunft im bisherigen Umfang abzugsfähig bleiben

12: Ein verschärftes Erbschaftsteuerrecht sowie eine Vermögensabgabe und eine Vermögen- steuer wären gerade für kleine und mittelständische Unternehmen eine untragbare Belas- tung und würden zu einem massiven Abfluss von Kapital und Vermögen aus Deutschland führen und viele Arbeitsplätze vernichten. Das lehnen wir ab.

# Linke
9: Hohe Einkommen müssen wieder mit einem Spitzensteuersatz von 53 Prozent besteuert werden. Zudem wollen wir eine Millionärsteuer auf hohe Vermögen einfüh- ren und eine Reform der Erbschaftsteuer.

10: Die Finanzmärkte und Banken müssen wirksam kontrolliert und in den Dienst der Gesellschaft gestellt werden. Wir wollen eine Finanztransaktionsteuer und eine europaweite einmalige Abgabe für Vermögen über einer Million Euro.

24: Hohe Vermögen, Spitzeneinkommen, Kapitalgewinne, Finanztransaktionen und große Erb - schaften müssen stärker beziehungs - weise überhaupt besteuert werden.

24: Wir fordern, eine Millionärsteuer – also eine Vermögensteuer für Millionäre – einzuführen. Dabei bleibt die erste Million des Vermögens steuerfrei. Danach wird ein Steuersatz in Höhe von fünf Prozent auf Pri- vat- und Betriebsvermögen erhoben, unter Abzug der darauf lastenden Schulden. Für betriebsnotwendiges Sachvermögen von Einzelunternehmerinnen und Einzelunter- nehmern und Personenunternehmen gilt ein erhöhter Freibetrag von fünf Millionen Euro.
Die Regelung stellt die Handlungsfähigkeit von (kleinen und mittleren) Unternehmen nicht in Frage. Sie verhindert, dass Privat-
vermögen in Betriebsvermögen verscho- ben und so der Millionärsteuer entzogen werden kann

25: Die Unternehmenssteuern wurden in den letzten Jahren massiv gesenkt. Die Körperschaftsteuer muss wieder auf 25 Prozent erhöht werden.

25: Um die unsoziale Wirkung der Umsatz- steuer auszugleichen, wird der ermäßig- te Umsatzsteuersatz auf Produkte und Dienstleistungen für Kinder, arbeitsinten- sive Handwerks-Dienstleistungen, apothe- kenpflichtige Arzneimittel sowie für den Schienenpersonenverkehr eingeführt. Bei

26: Mit einer Finanztransaktionsteuer wollen wir die Spekulationen auf den Finanzmärk- ten eindämmen und die Verursacherinnen und Verursacher der Krise an deren Kosten beteiligen.

26: Sehr hohe Einkommen wollen wir besonders besteuern: Jeder Euro, der – nach Abzug der Sozialversicherungsbei- träge – über einer Million Einkommen liegt, soll mit 75 Prozent besteuert werden (Reichensteuer).


# SPD

68: Arbeit darf nicht höher besteuert werden als Einkommen aus Kapitalvermögen. Des- halb wollen wir in einem ersten Schritt die Abgeltungssteuer unter Beibehaltung des Optionswahlrechtes von 25 Prozent auf 32 Prozent erhöhen. Sollten wir feststellen, dass das Aufkommen dieser Abgeltungssteuer geringer ausfällt als die voraussichtli- chen Einnahmen bei der Besteuerung mit dem persönlichen Einkommensteuersatz, wollen wir die Abgeltungssteuer innerhalb von drei Jahren abschaffen und die Kapital- erträge wieder der synthetischen Besteuerung unterwerfen

# CDU

13: Für uns gilt: Vorfahrt für Arbeit! Deshalb bleibt unser Ziel, die von Arbeitgebern und Arbeitnehmern zu glei- chen Teilen finanzierten Lohnzusatzkosten stabil unter 40 Prozent zu halten.

18: Klar aber ist, dass deutsche Unternehmen zu den Leid- tragenden [einer Vermögenssteuer] gehören würden.

17: Die oberen 25 Prozent der Steu- erpflichtigen haben 76,9 Prozent des Einkommensteuer- aufkommens geschultert. Wer diese Schraube überdreht, gefährdet den Zusammenhalt und schwächt die Leis- tungsbereitschaft der Menschen.
Mittelschicht

# Grüne
84: Die Abgeltungsteuer bevorzugt Kapital- gegenüber Arbeitsein-
kommen und ist damit eine Privilegierung der Rentiers auf Kosten der Allgemeinheit. Diese Subvention von Finanzinvestitionen gegenüber realen Investitionen und von Fremdkapital gegenüber Eigenkapital gehört abgeschafft und Kapitaleinkommen wieder progressiv be- steuert. Die Abzugsfähigkeit von Gehältern und Boni als Betriebs- ausgaben wollen wir auf 500.000 Euro beschränken, damit hohe Einkommen nicht weiter subventioniert werden.

87: Das derzeitige Einkommensteuersystem ist ungerecht. Wir erhö-
hen deshalb den Grundfreibetrag auf 8.700 Euro. Das kommt vor allem den Geringverdienern zugute. Gutverdiener sollen etwas mehr zur Finanzierung öffentlicher Leistungen beitragen. Wir wollen des- halb den Spitzensteuersatz für Einkommen ab 80.000 Euro auf 49 % erhöhen. Daneben wollen wir Kapitalerträge wie alle anderen Ein- kommen besteuern. Bisher werden Kapitalerträge, egal ob 10.000 oder 1 Mio. Euro, fest mit 25 % besteuert und damit ohne Grund gegenüber Einkommen aus Arbeit privilegiert.

# McCaffery
- McCaffery 2009 (819): tax. Most importantly, it develops more formally two norms about the taxation of capital: the yield-to-capital norm, which holds that the return to capital is an increment of value that ought to be taxed, and the ordinary-savings norm, which holds that savings that merely shift labor earnings within a lifetime or between taxpayers ought not to be excessively burdened. These two norms are in fatal tension under an income tax; in contrast, a consistent, progressive postpaid consumption tax accommodates both norms by design.

these are actually last reasons!

JIPEEEH I got it. Cafferty 2005: 918 says. Corporate income tax has two problems: it depends on incidence (economists disagree), and even if it does tax capital, it does so randomly, not progressively. All capital owners are taxed, not just the progressive ones.


# other last reasons Nozick

On distributive justice: no, it shouldn't be entitlement "that a person is entitled to those goods acquired in uncoerced exchanges with others" (Robert Nozick, as cited in Bankman, Griffith 1997: 1915)
I want a welfarist theory of distibritutive justice. It shouldn't be utilitarianism, it should be leximin / Rawls.
Also: dynamics / outliers / network effects (Benkler, matthias' guy) / inequality / spirit level.
Also: Hobbesian.

2: talks about the ideal combination that McCaffery's plan is: progressive appeals to liberals, exemption for avings and investment appeals to conservatives
3: skepticism that this ever will materialize. rather: the consumption tax supporters want a flat VAT, the progressive guys want an income tax
2: was considered post WW1 (graduated spendings tax), Mill's proposal again in1942 by Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau (graduated surtax on spending), and lastly in 1995 by Sen Sam Nunn, Pete Domenici, Bob Kerrey Unlimited Savings Allowance (USA Tax).
4: numbers for the PCT can be found here (US example, progression up to 50%).
4: Haig-Simons definition of income: I=C+A
debt repayment would be deducted from income (it's a form of investment), debt spending however would be consumption
5: estate and gift tax, according to McCaffery can be safely abolished. Dead people don't spend. Their heirs pay when they spend.
7: two ideas were present from the very beginning: place the burden on the wasteful spender, never the investor. Also, make it more equitable, yet efficient.
10: the progressives were against it because it didn't tax firms, nor property as such
10: the regressives were against it, well, because it was progressive, they wanted flat ax, already back in 1921.
10: Representative Stevenson asked: "[put] into effect the proposition according to what a man spends and graduate it according as he spends it, and the United States Government will have to have an auditor behind every man in the country who has any money to spend. How would you ever carry it out?"
15: "Under the progressive consumption tax, Hazelett explained, "we define income as what it really is. there is no economic income but the living standard of the taxpayer".
this point is key: things OUT to be about consumption!
18, 19: the USA tax had to problems: it didn't include borrowing as income and it didn't terminate the estate and gift taxes (which are transfers, not new consumption)
19: Both in 1942 and in 1995 the PCT failed because of its complexities: the more complexity you introduce, the more devils, the more rejection. With that rise chances for evasion: flat and sales tax proponents are disenchanted
Think about the problems of old savings: we have to know about these, do a full cash flow status of people.
as cited on  22 As McCaffery writes, "I will not add fuel to think tank fires. Complexity can wait. The devil may indeed dwell in the details, but we first need to find an angel or two in the abstractions that govern tax."
idea: the PCT is between a rock and a hard place in terms of how people like it in the political spectrum! But that doesn't need to be so. there is nothing inherently good about the income tax.
actually, the PCT provides a possibility to fight evasion: you can force people to prove where they have invested and treat it as consumption, otherwise. The problem, of course,  need to think this through

## Fried 1992

There are three arguments, says Fried 965 why savers and spenders ought to be treated the same, and she says, they're all flawed
1) Abstinence ideas: savers and spenders ought tob ear equivalent tax burdens because they have equivalent wealth ex post, once the costs of deferreing consumtpion are accounted for
this is, in fact, as fried notes 967, an improved income tax.
the abstinence justification is: you have costs when deferring consumptions, psychic costs. OR: you have less utility for the remaining lifetime
2) Bradford: savers and spenders ought to bear equivalent tax burdens, whether or not they are in equivalent positions ex post, because they face equivalent choices ex ante
3) savers and spenders ought to bear the equivalent tax burdens because they are entitled to preserve the relative ex post advantages, whether equivalent or not, that they enjoy in a no-tax world.
now here is a key argument (971) she argues that the abstinence theory is wrong, because we never compensate for pscychic cost of at the margin-leisure, we don't do this for workers, they work at the margin of where they are indifferent between working and not working. But we don't reward them enduring the psychic cost of working, we just tax them anyway. So they will include this in their rationales for working more. Her argument is: then why do it for the psychic cost of saving?!?
here's a tentative solution: we do that for workers, actually, and we should: it's the base-rate of only consumption, which I think we should continue


## a desire that others not understanding

We sometimes hear it is only a "matter of timing" when we pay the income tax. This , McLure 1988 as cited in Seidman 125 writes, is either because  "Such a statement reveals a basic failure to understand - or a desire that others not understand - the nature of income taxation and tax avoidance: (...) If income tax can be postponed (...), interest (or other capital income) can be earned on a tax deferred basis in the meantime". in other words: compound interest, is ignored.


## bad cycles

## Ganghof 2007

notes two things:
income taxation isn't enough, it needs to be on capital, too
income taxation nesd to be progressive
provides a cool argument 1063 how (institutional) veto playing may favor, rather than weaken the forces of retrenchmecn because of the wide-reaching legal changes that would be required to avoid retrechnment
Kato 2003 as cited in ibid 1064: yes, a revenue shift to regressive taxes makes it politically easier to maintain a large public sector (51) but that is a bad idea, it's not the idea of a welfare state
1075 says that there are few major overhauls of tax systems because they are associated with significant transaction costs and political risks, so centrist and pragmatic policy makers will avoid that.


## Ganghof 2004

scharpf in foreword 12 cites the negative employment effects of high social contributions, also inequitable because they're strictly proportional
also in scharpf foreword 13: MwST does 2 bad things: it depresses the price-elastic demand for low-qualification service industry jobs (which is very bad) and it raises the costs of living for everyone.
Scharpf is right when he says there is much to explain about the chaos of german tax. In fact, there is MUCH more to be explained if you look at a perfect counterfactual.
19 CIT and PIT highest marginal rates are same in Germany since 1977 (and for a  good reason)
25 make this key point: when Ganghof suggests a dual income tax for germany, fundamental equity (OR efficiency) concerns are long past. 25. He cites two "pragmatic reasons" 1) it will be easier to find a cap income tax rate that is low enough to include as many as possible kinds of cap income. 2) labor incomes can still be taxed progressively.
wow, where's the innovation?

## Genschel 2004

the sceptics and the revisionists have it wrong: because they lack the right counterfactual 616
the welfare state is indeed, and rightly so, expected to do 2 things as Genschel 617 writes (this is part of the two criterion)
to systematically control economic developments at the macro-level (macro-economic control), and
to guarantee, unconditionally, adequate living standards at the micro-level (redistributive social policy)

note that really depreciation isn't all that difficult: we do that for firms, too and we do it fairly roughly. We can do that for households, too. Also: if people sell their stuff at some point, we may even allow them to correct for the depreciation up or downwards.


## mcCaffery: misunderstandings

is right indeed "the canonical understanding of consumption taxes changes under consistently progressive rates. No longer are prepaid and postpaid consumption taxes - taxes on wages and spending, respecitbely - equivalent. Postpaid consumption taxes can and do burden the yield to capital, and not in an arbitrary, random way. Far from it: A progressive postpaid consumption tax emerges as the fairest and least arbitrary of all comprehensive tax systems, precisely because it chooses to make its decisions about the appropriate level of progressivity at the right time. In doind so, it burdens some but not all uses of capital and its yield. and for normatively attractive reasons". (812)
wow.
"This traditional view has generated an impoverished choice set for tax, consisting of a badly flawed status quo on the one hand and a flat consumption tax of some sort on the other. Under the guiding light of the traditional view, we are heading ever closer towards a flat wage tax." 812
"Under progressive tax rates a postpaid, cash-flow or (all equivalently) spending tax is not equivalent to a yield-exempt or wage tax" 813

governing dynamics of inequality.
"Genuinely progressive taxation is necessarily personal taxation" (Vickrey 1947 "Agenda for Progressive taxation" as cited in MCCafferty 830)

Hobbes and smith come down for consumption taxes. Both the father of economics and the father of the state
Hobbes, Leviathan 386-87
[T]he equality of imposition, consisteth rather in the equality of that which is consumed than of the riches of the persons that consume the same. For what reason is there that he which laboureth much, and sparing the fruits of his labour, consumeth little, should be more charged than he that living idlely, getteth little, and spendeth all he gets, seeing the one hath no more protection from the commonwealth than the other? But when the impositions are laid upon those things which men consume, every man payeth equally for what he useth, nor is the commonwealth defrauded by the luxurious waste of private men.
Smith
Every tax ought to be levied at the time, or in the manner, in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it.... Taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury, are all finally paid by the consumer, and generally in a manner that is very convenient for him. He pays them little by little, as he has occasion to buy the goods. As he is at liberty too, either to buy, or not to buy, as he pleases, it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconveniency from such taxes. Smith supra note 54 in cafferty
McCaffery says the USA mistake came from mistaking the Haigs-Simon definition: "an is had become an ought" (emphgasis in original. 840 MccFfery
this comes from Andrew's' idea that the most sophisticated reason for the PCT would be principled nontaxation of the yield to capital. That is the wrong reason! It is taxed, too. just differently.
yields to capital are taxed, and only there where they elevate living standards (that's vertical quity) as opposed to horizontal equity between saving, then spending
McCaffery makes this very point that progressivity, even though desired, is disappearing because of the choice of really bad tax choice.

848: "Advocates of redistributive taxes must wake up and realize that their end is in jeopardy on account of their poor choice of means: they are fighting, and losing, the wrong war."
Neutrality in comparison to a no-tax world seems nice, but is a problematic thing.

if you avoid distortion of the saving-spending decision, you skew the work-leisure tradeoff.
comment on this!
neutrality, or rather, fairness, narrowly understood as economic welfarist perspective (the optimal tax literature) is bad.
1) judgment of fairness need to take the pretax status quo as normatively appropriate
2) optimal welfare-maximizing tax answer may clash with ordinary moral intutions and reflective normative commitments


Make the point of lumpy earner, steady earner and trust fund baby *878) compare to the other tersm used for the same thing.
note, as McCaffery does on 883 that private markets can also solve the consumer durables smoothing problem: leasing, reanting.
the income tax problem for the propertied classes gets even worse because of the "wait until realiziation" and the "wait until debt is repaid" problem - bth may never happen for the super rich (this is McCaffery 888) (at least this shifts the time problem, and may make it very problematic. in the US, the fact that things canthat are inherited can be sold at fair market value free of tax makes this an even bigger problem. This is an extension of the CIT problem actually, a problem that maters for all things where accretions are not immediatley realized. "Tax planning 101 is elegantly simple: buy, borrow, die" (890)
this can't be easily solved, it's an admoinositratove nightmare.
hence the backstop of the estate and gift tax.
this is it: DYSFUNCTIONS OF THE BACKSTOPS. Dysfunctional backstoppers of PIT: CIT, PIT.
nice quote "THings in tax today are bad" (McCaffery 893)

899: "Together with the basic tax planning of buy/borrow/die, lower tax rates on capital realizations and corporate dividends, cash-value life insurance, and the taxation of home-ownership, the new developments in retirement savings help to move tax towards a world in which citizens will pay taxes on their wages, under a compressed rate structure, and never again. This is the world of prepaid consumption, or wage, taxation"
people arbitrage their way toward a falt, wage-tax.


"Corporations are legal fictions".
 the key moral intuition, and Rawlsian reflective equilibrium is this: it seems fair and appropriate to burden capital ransactions when these facilitate or enable a better lifestyle, reflecting a greater "ability to pay" or more "benefits received" from the social compact. But it does not seem fair and appropriate to burden capital transactions when they are used simply and sensibly to move around in time uneven labor market earnings." 921
 
 "People treat a plan as realistic when it approximates what already exists and as utopican when it departs from current arrangements. Only proposals that are hardly worht fighting for - reformist tinkering - seem practicable" (Roberto Managebrai Unger, False Necesseity 12 1987 as cited in McCaffery 938)

 > "A progressive postpaid consumption tax emerges as the fairest and least arbitrary of all comprehensive tax systems, precisely because it chooses to make its decisions about the appropriate level of progressivity at the right time.

 > Edward J. McCaffery (2005: 812).

 There are three types of taxes
 1. Income taxes (including capital incomes)
 2. Prepaid consumption taxes (VAT), or, equivalently, payroll taxes, or, equivalently social contributions (such as statutory health insurance, unemployment insurance, pensions, etc. in Germany)
 3. Postpaid, progressive consumption taxes ("The Perfect Tax"), based on a cash flow account of spending (Consumption = Income - Savings / aka Haig-Simons definition of income).

 There are two savings norms (as in: what exactly is saving?)
 1. Ordinary Savings Norm: saving is just postponed consumption, "smoothed out" over the lifetime. Nominal interest is just a compensation for postponement (think: inflation, risk, growth, discounting of the future). Incomes from savings (= capital incomes) should not be taxed.
 2. Yield-to-Capital Norm: incomes from savings are a genuine accretion to wealth. Interest is income.  Incomes from savings (= capital incomes) should be taxed.
 	Note:
 	- Income taxes (if complete) adopt a yield-to-capital norm. All capital incomes are (ideally) taxed. (In reality, as McCafferty explained, they hardly ever are, because there are systemic flaws, such as "tax evasion 101")
 	- Prepaid consumption taxes (or VAT, or payroll, or social contributions) adopt an ordinary savings norm. No capital incomes are taxed.
 	- Postpaid progressive consumption taxes (or spending taxes, or cash flow based consumption taxes) tax some capital incomes. To the extent that (dis!)saving is used to smooth out consumption, interest is not taxed. To the extent that it is used to enhance lifestyle, or for lumpy consumption (opposite of smoothed out), it is taxed.
 	For a review of different taxes and how they work, consider my prospectus (again attached), pages 60-66
 	Consider this example to understand that a VAT (German MwSt.) is the same as a proportional payroll or proportional social contribution.


 ## The Detective Story of Income Taxation (Who Dunnit? Who killed progressivity?)

 > "The real and pressingly practical question for tax is not whether to have an income or a consumption tax, but what form of consumption tax to have. The stakes in this battle are clear and dramatic: the fate of progressivity in tax lies in the balance."
 > Edward J. McCaffery (2005: 817)

 > "Advocates of redistributive taxes must wake up and realize that their end is in jeopardy on account of their poor choice of means: they are fighting, and losing, the wrong war."
 > Edward J. McCaffery (2005: 848)

 The political alternatives now seem to be between progressive income tax and prepaid proportional/flat consumption tax (VAT, Social Contributions, Payroll, all equivalent). This is an incomplete choice set.
 The one progressive component of today's tax regimes, the personal income tax, has deficient backstops.
 - Estate and gift taxes (buy, borrow, die)
 - Corporate income tax (indeterminate incidence, no progression, indeterminate location of value generation)

 The personal income tax as structural flaws, remaking the PIT ever more into a wage or prepaid consumption tax.
 1. Macomber. Tax on accession/accrual or tax on realization? The Supreme Court rules: you can tax only on realization (selling).
 	this problem is much exacerbated in the case of income in illiquid assets.
 2. Tax Planning 101 aka Buy, Borrow, Die. Mrs Macomber could simply borrow on her (appreciating!) stock as collateral. Recall that borrowing, is not income under an income tax. Mrs Macomber can spend out of the borrowing tax-free.
 3. Heirs never pay the estate tax, because that is (as it makes sense) a net tax on assets minus liabilities. In the extreme case of Tax Planning 101, there is no estate.
 4. Also, Tax Planning 101 incentivizes people to never realize, to never sell. This may lead to markets freezing up and asset as well as derivatives (!) bubbles, at great cost to the economy.

	%382``There is some evidence of a connection between blood concentrations of the neurotransmitter serotonin—the so-called ‘happiness hormone’—and dominance. Unusually high levels of serotonin have been found in officers of college fraternities, athletic team captains and officers and crew members on an extended sailing voyage (Frank 1985: 23–8). Richard Wilkinson has linked being in a subordinate position with heightened levels of stress and depressed levels of serotonin (Wilkinson 1996). Increased levels of the central stress hormone cortisol, which can be measured in blood and saliva, have been found in individuals whose self-esteem and social status are threatened, and stress has been positively linked to The status of happiness 383 poor health and increased obesity. Low or declining social status has also been associated in some studies with poor cardiovascular health (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009: 38, 191; Marmot 2004).
	%383: Rousseau may be right, but it might be nature already: While there is some evidence that he was more or less right about this, it seems as though our preoccupation with status and relative position is rooted in our natures which, according to evolutionary psychology, are ‘adaptive responses shaped by man’s biological nature and situation on earth’ (Hirschleifer 1978: 321).

In such a setting, ‘low social status is an evolutionary dead end,’ to put it bluntly (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009: 204). For
	%``What mattered for survival in this environment was one’s position relative to local rivals with whom individuals and groups were in direct, immediate competition for food and sex, ‘whereas comparisons with others who are distant in time and space are typically irrelevant’, from an evolutionary perspective (Frank 2007: 57). One of the central findings of Robert Frank is that most people today are relatively indifferent to the wealth and status of people far removed from them, whereas they ‘care deeply about where they stand in their various local hierarchies’ (Frank 1985: 107). Hence,''
	%``For example, the voluntary simplicity movement seeks to overthrow ‘the god of positional consumption’ (Schor 1999: 61) in the name of reduced consumption, anti- materialism and sustainable development. A policy of deliberate ‘downshifting’ typically involves working less, earning less and consuming less so that there is more time to better enable people to pursue other goods. Such a lifestyle would be materially poorer than now but richer in non-material, non-positional goods and therefore happier. To the extent that it is possible to reduce the speed of the consumption treadmill so that less time and fewer resources are expended on the joyless pursuit of positional goods and status, we may be able to devote ourselves to more intrinsically satisfying activities and forms of consumption that actually improve our quality of life, such as higher air quality, more urban parkland, cleaner drinker water, reducing violent crime (Frank 1999: 11).''

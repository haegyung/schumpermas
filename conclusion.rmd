<!-- [ ] you won't get there entirely (fung on revolution and deliberation) -->

<!-- Note somewhere that risk (for example, Beck) may be another topic for deliberation. Here, too, people have systematic misunderstandings (Kahnemann 2012), and it's about power (Paul Slovic) but there are also some truths (Sunstein), it's the same conflict between objective truth and relative truths and autonomy. -->


<!-- Dr.~Pangloss is really giving optimism a bad name. If anyone is an optimist, it's Candide: ``Let us cultivate our garden.''. -->
<!-- get Cervantes here: the sickest/craziest person is whoever accepts the world as it is, not as it ought to be. -->


<!-- really be hard about this: this is a charge that civicon (thin leftiest supporter) also faces: does it just mullify dissent? -->
<!-- - feminist critique: mullifying critique -->
<!-- but, I would argue, it mullifies dissent not because of learning phases, but because there was not enough -->
<!-- My answer out of that is actually - counterintuitively -- longer, deeper, learning.
actually this is a somewhat fundamental addition: it's not just "facilitating dialogue" (whoch is what deliberation seems to degenerate into) – we need "didactiv reduction"; again the schools for democracy goes quite deep here. -->

<!-- deliberation is messy, it's not fast, and it does not scale, that is just the way of the lifeworld.
programming is much nicer.
but it's not clear that we can do without this -->


## Limitations

<!-- limitation: there wer eno liberals! -->

<!-- limitation: did not really get into the whole ses-status / different cognitive ability Stufentarif
If, even under the brand of liberal democracy most demanding of political autonomy, people of lower cognitive ability or socio-economic status were to misunderstand taxation, be unable to engage in reciprocally comprehensible argument and as a result, opt for taxes against their material interest, social inequality research would face a whole new process of perpetuating privilege.
Not only as social scientists, but as citizens, too, we must know how no one gets left behind in our schools of democracy [@DeTocqueville1840; @Rosenberg-2002-aa].
Liberal democracy, at bottom, requires that political participation *can* be made autonomous from power, status and wealth, and on this condition hinges the feasibility of liberalism as a political philosophy [@GutmannThompson-2004-aa K1431]. -->


## Further Research

<!-- ittq? -->
<!-- poll q dims separately -->

<!-- Ideal: Citizen Scientists
this could be down for a longer period of time, maybe several weeks per year, and these people would return to their communities and be knowledge about some things in great detail.
It’s not so much about teaching these people what’s going on, but about making them ask their own questions – they become, rather than learn from scientists.
Oddly, these lay scientists may be the bests scientists all around; because they are pragmatic, and they are unencumbered by strategic considerations that all to often plague the modern economy. -->

do a fishbowl after the learning phase, to harvest questions (“ich hab’ das so verstanden”)
problematize (this is via Anne) models; they always only tell part of the story
begin the first round by telling stories
don’t explain more outside of groups: we’re doing this because we want to advance to the stuff that people can disagree on; not factual questions, those are the most interesting ones
consider doing dinner outside
get mic and speakers
figure out a video or something else that will tease on people, make them think about this
cc moderators
do the press conference outside?
do a fishbowl for a press conference
get fruit for coffee breaks
get a fireplace
remember to work out

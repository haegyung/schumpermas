I here propose to investigate a supposed difference in current, and (more) ideal speech thinking about tax by subjecting a group of diverse citizens to a deliberative forum on the topic, which, in one succinct summary [@Steenbergen2003 25ff], is marked by

1. open *participation*, including setting the agenda and deciding on procedures (@Benhabib-1996-aa, @Chambers1995, @Cohen-1989-aa, @Habermas1992 [370ff])
2. mutual *justification* of assertions and validity claims [@Habermas1992 370],
3. orientation on the *common good* [@Rawls-1971],
<!-- not sure about this, it's kinda downstream from habermas -->
4. *respect* for one another, as well as one's arguments (@Gutmann1996, @Macedo1999), other-directedness, empathy and solidarity,
5. *constructive politics* of a widely acceptable decision over well-defined policy alternatives, ideally --- though not necessarily --- by consensus [@Cohen-1989-aa 23],
6.  *authenticity* in sincere, not strategic communication [@Habermas-1984 149]
<!-- %add here, maybe: manifest equality as demanded by Cohen -->

## Reciprocity

Deliberation is no such catalogue of first-order considerations of what would make a good (efficient, fair, sustainable) decision in any given policy field, but instead, a second-order prescription to resolve disagreement *over* those very the moral and causal arguments [@GutmannThompson-2004-aa 125].
Still, and in contrast to pluralism, it places more than just *procedural* claims, but posits *substantive* requirements for how agreement must be reached.
Succinctly, @GutmannThompson-2004-aa demand that "your fellow citizens must give reasons that are comprehensible to you" [-@GutmannThompson-2004-aa K177].
More than merely intelligible, permissible arguments to reach deliberative agreement must raise validity [@Habermas-1984] and moral [@Rawls-1971] claims *universally* acceptable to everyone.

Logically, it must then be theoretically possible for any *given* argument to *fail* that test, and to be impermissible --- including the arguments brought forward by experts.
In fact, deliberation reserves no special place for nominal experts at all, except if and to the extent that these experts have arrived at, and present their agreement under the standards of deliberation.

As noted in the above, any research design that axiomatizes any disagreement between experts (or ex-ante logic) as *misunderstandings* on the part of the non-experts fails the deliberative standard, no matter the supposedly enlightening de-biasing treatments.

The desiderata of taxation and deliberation are seemingly in conflict.
Taxation requires people to consider an exogenously given catalogue of abstractions, and deliberation implies that no such set of arguments can be unconditionally accepted.
This is a general contradiction of procedural and substantively epistemic formulations of deliberative democracy [@Bohman1998 402].

This impasse has real repercussions for the proposed research design:
apparently, it can serve only one master.
Either, participants misunderstandings can be revealed by treating them with introductory economics, *or* they can deliberate any which arguments they themselves find comprehensible.

As with so much that deliberative theory is up against this is a false dichotomy.[^false_dichotomies]

[^false_dichotomies]: For example, political participation versus enlightened understanding versus political equality, as @Fishkin2009 points out.

Argumentative reciprocity implies that expert knowledge be neither presumed, nor negated, but that these arguments --- as all others --- be allowed to demonstrate their universal causal and moral validity.

<!-- %``Mutual justification means not merely offering reasons to other people, or even offering reasons that they happen to accept [\ldots] \citep[98]{GutmannThompson-2004-aa}.
%	It means providing reasons that constitute a justification for imposing binding laws on them.
%	What reasons count as such a justification is inescapably a substantive question.
%	Merely formal standards for mutual justification --- such as a requirement that maxims implied by laws be generalizable --- are not sufficient.%plagiarism? -->

Expert- and non-expert (as all other) arguments must not merely be balanced in terms of airtime or affect, but "the considerations offered in favor of, or against, a proposal, candidate or policy \[must\] be answered in a substantive way by *those who advocate a different position*" [@Fishkin2009 K550, emphasis added].
Deliberation is, in other words, when non-experts answer expert arguments *on their own, expert terms*, and vice versa, too.
Surely, the relation of this ideal to practice is "aspirational", too, as all in deliberation [@Fishkin2009 K2679].
So far, democratic theorists have failed to show "how to incorporate the need for expertise and technical administration in a deliberative democracy" [@Thompson2008 515] and "\[a\] great deal of work on deliberative theory focuses on conflicting values, religious toleration, identities and so on, and relatively little on conflicting facts" [@Moore2011 2].

Yet, for the deliberative experimenter, this aspiration to argumentative reciprocity is the ultimate hypothesis in need of falsification, including reciprocity with expert arguments.
If expert knowledge on taxation is presumed valid, and any dissent chalked up as misunderstandings the aspiration of communicative action could *never* be falsified.
Likewise, if expert knowledge on taxation is not given adequate opportunity to be reciprocally considered on its own terms, communicative action will *always* be violated.
Neither of those formats would provide construct-valid deliberation.
Expert knowledge is then "a special case of the general problem of convincing those who are not 'in the room' to accept the results of a deliberation in which they did not directly participate" [@Moore2011 2].
This problem can only be resolved by a "democratic conception of expert authority" [@Moore2011 2], that is, if deliberative standards are extended to expert arguments, too.
A good deliberative format brings ordinary citizens into this business:
they must be enabled to the farthest extent possible to argue expert as well as non-expert claims on their own terms, including the possibility to reject expert opinion if it is found insufficiently reciprocal in argument.

Because bringing ordinary citizens into this business, and *equally* so, is, as @Rosenberg-2002-aa's so difficult, deliberations must "be regarded as remedial institutions" [-@Rosenberg-2007-aa 12] and more, "they must be sites for political education and development" [-@Rosenberg-2007-aa 13].

<!-- %%Mansbridge 2010
%	%   * points out that deliberative polling mostly does not include radical solutions, perspectives (that could be a problem)

%Any such reduction would violate the spirit of deliberation; citizens could not set their own agenda.
%Any such reduction may well fail to elucidate my hypothesized misunderstandings: I imagine “understanding tax” as a bucket, which, if leaky will drain to the lowest level.
%For example, if deliberators would discuss most aspects of taxation, but skip over the limits (!) of price controls, they may well opt for price controls in lieu of, or in addition to taxation.

%Meaningfully deliberating tax requires a lot of knowledge, and that knowledge is unlikely to spring merely from the act of deliberation, but it needs some input.

## Remedial Deliberation

If their democratic rule is to be enlightened, deliberators must also engage a set of abstractions concerning its optimality, justice and sustainability as well as problematize the view of human motivation, utility and rationality implied by these (economic) abstractions.
<!-- TODO link to old tax sections in the above -->
Deliberators must also understand the means and ends of an (ideal) mixed economy within which taxation reconciles allocation by plan and by exchange, including respective government and market failures.
@Warren2008 [K1513], reporting on the [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"}, notes that such learning phases are "crucial to its ability to render a decision, and indeed" and that it *can be done*:
"the decision was a learned and sophisticated one";
"Most members transformed themselves from lay citizens with little knowledge of electoral systems into experts over a period of several months (...)" [-@Warren2008 K1513].
Any deliberation that fails to engage such technical but broadly consensual --- if not entirely coherent --- concerns, must be considered unenlightened.
It would ignore some of the causal relationships and moral alternatives that we must assume exist, if and to the extent that we accept the economic ontology of coexisting states and markets.

The fora, even though featuring learning phases, must not regress to a (traditional) classroom setting in which the economics teacher knows best.
Still, this *is* the inescapable challenge of deliberation in the modern world, as @Moore2011 points out:
"the ideal of citizen equality to deliberate issues that affect them is in tension with the inequalities of knowledge that are inherently governing complex societies", *but* "the question is not *whether* expert authority is part of the deliberative system, but *how* it is integrated and whether *this integration is itself subject to deliberative standards*" [@Moore2011 14, emphasis added].

<!-- cite rosenberg to argue for learning phases: -->
<!-- % \subsection{Political Psychology}
% Communicative action is very demanding of the cognitive and moral faculties of deliberators.
% Political psychologists have problematized these demands that deliberation poses \citep{Rosenberg-2002-aa} --- especially, but not only, deliberation of highly abstract topics.
% Troublingly for deliberative democracy of the Habermasian kind, recent research in political psychology suggests, that --- contrary to the bounded rationality assumption \citep[for example,][]{Simon-1999-aa,Kahneman2011} --- imperfect human reasoning may not only stem from remediable cognitive scarcity, but may be developmentally determined.
% \citet{Rosenberg-2002-aa} has proposed a threefold developmental sequence and typology of \emph{sequential}, \emph{linear} and \emph{systematic} reasoning.
% %TODO add better rosenberg references
% His empirical accounts suggest that if any, only systematic thinkers will be able to meet the cognitive demands for reasoned arguments, and egalitarian free speech of deliberative democracy.
% Moreover, this cognitive competence was found \emph{not} to be domain specific, and while people may regress to lower levels of competence under high loads or appropriate cues, they are unlikely to easily, if ever, achieve higher than developed levels.
% ``Structurally (more and) less developed reasoning adults'' make ``not only the adequacy of citizens' reasoning, but also their \emph{equality}'' a problem for deliberative democracy \citep[12, emphasis added]{Rosenberg-2007-aa}.

% On this red flag, too, much of deliberative practice is silent.
% While deliberative formats routinely strive to attract diverse participants and ensure their equal participation \citep{Fishkin2009}, they rarely problematize, or measure the substantive, argumentative \emph{equality} of participants.
% Among the small research that has looked into argumentative equality of actual (\gls{dp}) proceedings, \cite{Siu} finds that information, rather than education of participants is related to argument quality \emph{at the small group level}, but offers no individual-level analysis.
% There is also yet --- to my knowledge --- no research that tracks how limited and unequal capacities for moral and causal reasoning may filter up to understandings of, and preferences over complex policy issues.
% Here, too, taxation is a good case to test the promise of deliberative fora:
% it demands both advanced moral and causal reasoning, and raises controversies and tradeoffs likely to impact the life-chances of people along similar socio-economic dimensions as those related to cognitive competence.

% Based on his sobering findings, \citet[20]{Rosenberg-2007-aa} also suggests a revised understanding of deliberation:

% \begin{quotation}
% 	\emph{``Deliberative fora must not be regarded simply as empty stages that provide a venue for the realization of citizenship;
% 	nor must the design of these deliberative stages focus simply on the removal of obstructions that may inhibit freedom or give unequal scope for maneuver.
% 	Instead, deliberation must be understood as a site for the construction and transformation of citizenship.
% 	In deliberation, citizens are made as well as realized.
% 	The operative metaphor here is that of a school, but of particular kind.
% 	The educational goal is not the transmission of specific beliefs and values, although these are by no means irrelevant.
% 	Rather the central aim must be to foster the requisite cognitive development for a fuller autonomy, a greater communicative competence and a better ability to engage in a collaborative effort to make good and just public policy.''}
% 	\\*
% 	--- Shawn W.\ \citet[20]{Rosenberg-2007-aa}
% \end{quotation}

% This ``reforming'' variant of \citeauthor{Habermas-1984}' vision --- informed by empirical facts about our time, and our people --- also bears on the analysis and operationalization of deliberation.
% \emph{School}, as \citeauthor{Rosenberg-2007-aa} reminds us, is the ``operative metaphor'', one that balances furthering of equality and citizens' autonomy.

%note that the link between rosenbergs sequence thinking and my tax misunderstandings is still to be developed -->


## Format

Consequently, a good format for deliberating tax includes a strong learning component, where participants are introduced to the structured choices and relevant abstractions suggested by experts, including their disagreements, conditions and uncertainties.
Deliberators are unlikely to cover these extensive grounds by themselves, or pick them up from (very limited) briefing books and will benefit from well-planned lessons.
On the other hand, a good format must also feature extensive small-group discussion, where participants talk amongst themselves, shielded from the authority of expertise.
Deliberators may benefit from a trained, non-expert moderator and/or scribe to assist, structure and document their discussion.
Most importantly, participants must be encouraged to adjudicate the validity claims of economics, to contrast and possibly relate those to their own, and other claims.

As noted earlier, most deliberative formats include --- often moderated --- small-group discussion, but few add to that a substantive learning component.[^dps]

[^dps]: [dps]{acronym-label="dp" acronym-form="plural+short"}, the pronounced methodological gold standard of deliberation [@Mansbridge2010] are too short to feature long lessons, and confine expert knowledge to ad-hoc question and answer sessions with experts and limited briefing books [@Fishkin2009].
    Citizen Juries [@SmithWales-2000-aa], Planning Cells [@Dienel-1999-aa] and related formats also include no learning components, and some experimenters even advise against expert knowledge.

Among those that do are the small-n Danish-developed Consensus Conferences [@Grundahl1995] and especially the large-n, one-off [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"} in British Columbia, Canada [@Citizen-2004-aa].
Consensus Conferences have been held on very technical issues, including nanotechnology [@LeeKleinman2007] or genetically modified foods, and the Citizen Assembly was tasked to recommend an alternative electoral system for the province.
Much like taxation, technology policy, and especially electoral systems design also demand highly structured choices (for example, a seat allocation rule or regulation) and raises a set of abstractions (party systems or risk distributions).

In a Consensus Conference, 12-15 self-selected but diverse citizens discuss a technical matter of political relevance for three or more days (!) and issue a report on their discussions [@LeeKleinman2007].
In preparation for the conference, participants read quite extensive background material, which they discuss during the first of several daylong sessions.
At later sessions, they (publicly) share their questions with experts and finally draft a report for the sponsoring body and/or the media.
@LeeKleinman2007 report that a positive atmosphere, good organization and skillful facilitation are necessary for a successful Consensus Conference.
They also recommend that participants tell their stories, which moderators then weave into themes, to help citizens relate their experiences to expert knowledge [-@LeeKleinman2007 159].

The [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"} expanded on this model.
Over the course of a year, 160 randomly selected British Columbians read and learned about electoral systems, held public hearings, deliberated amongst themselves and, after several intermediate votes, recommended a (quite complicated) [stv]{acronym-label="stv" acronym-form="singular+short"}-variant and drafted a report [@Citizen-2004-aa].
The extensive learning phase, spanning six (!) weekends stands out among deliberative experiments.
In addition to a university-level textbook on electoral systems, Citizens received interactive lectures accompanied by small discussion groups.
An expert panel vetted the learning phase for impartiality and accuracy of information.
Participants also developed a set of shared values during the learning phase, both (procedurally) for how they wished to deliberate and (substantively) for a desirable electoral system.


## Implementation

The [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"} provides an ideal blueprint for a deliberative forum on tax;
however, limited resources and lack of experience do not permit such a large undertaking for this project.

Instead, the project proposed here is a scaled-down hybrid, combining the ambitious learning phases of a Citizen Assembly, with the more intimate, small-n interaction and participant empowerment of Consensus Conferences.[^learning_phase_ca]

[^learning_phase_ca]: The [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"} also featured a "listening phase" [@Pearse2008 1609] during which members held public hearings throughout the province, drawing some 3,000 attendees and 1,600 written submissions.
    Both because I do not have the resources and --- absent a mandate --- expect limited public interest, I plan no such phase.

A small, self-selected sample of 15-24 diverse, ideally randomly-sampled, citizens will attend around 6 days of learning and deliberation spread over several weeks.
A provisional schedule is included in (p. ).

After introducing the format and framing the issue, deliberators are invited to tell stories about experiences with taxation, following @Mansbridge2010a [67]'s recommendation:
'Stories can establish credibility, create empathy, and trigger a sense of injustice, all of which contribute directly or indirectly to justification'' [-@Mansbridge2010a 67].
Deliberators also share opinions and grievances about tax as well as identify relevant questions and issues, which will be taken up in, and structure the later learning phases.
During these learning sessions, taking up less than half of the time, participants receive information about the structured choices and relevant abstractions of taxation from the author.
These lessons are organized around themes and values identified by deliberators in an initial session, and attempt to relate the subject matter to participant experiences.
Learning sessions alternate with extensive small-group deliberations, during which participants reflect on the lessons, relate or contrast it to their own experiences and claims and adjudicate the validity of the presented moral and causal arguments.
Small-group deliberations are facilitated by a trained moderator, who has no expertise in taxation or economics.
At the end of the process, participants must agree on a tax and write a report outlining their recommendation, which can be released to the public.
If resources permit, participants will also hear a panel of expert witnesses to discuss their questions.

This project should be in the bold cells. -->

- 8-16 participants (depending on funding) (Crosby et al suggest a maximum of 24 for meaningful plenary sessions). \cite[loc. 1888]{CrosbyNethercut-2005-aa}
- 5-7 days (depending on funding)
- face-to-face, all-day including common lodging and meals
- Includes learning phases, expert panels and small group / plenary deliberation, modelled roughly on the Citizen Assembly (electoral reform in Britsh Columbia)
- Deliberators are briefed with an extensive issue book, material is reviewed during the deliberation.
- Issue book and learning phases are “vetted” by a diverse panel of economists (e.g. Hickel, Traub, Sauernheimer, Frank)
- Learning phases are held by Max Held, organized along questions from draft chapters on tax and mixed economy, reframed for maximum accessibility.
	Learning phases are interrupted by moderated, small-group sessions, in which deliberators reflect on what they have learned and relate it to personal experience, judgements and understandings.
	Crosby et al. stress face-to-face, extended interviews of expert witnesses, rather than written issue books or presentations (\cite[loc. 1899]{CrosbyNethercut-2005-aa}
	Carson & Hartz-Karp recommend panels of stakeholders, instead -- I'd rather go with scientists, because stakeholders (political parties etc.) are way too deep in this game already, and may fail to ask the deepest, most relevant questions about tax.
- Deliberation phases are held (in plenary and small groups) by 2-3 trained moderators.
	Moderators guide the discussion and encourage an agenda of questions, but are not experts in the field.
	Max Held does not participate in the deliberation phases.
	(Supposed expertise must not silence debate or dissent).
	People with experience in teaching, intercultural communication or community organising might make good moderators (e.g. Anja Jungermann).
- The sample is *not* representative, but seeks to maximize diverse backgrounds, experiences and preferences.
	It’s a *saturation* / stratified ranom sample. Details
	- A random sample is drawn and invited to “apply”.
		If no random sample can be drawn (expensive), a random geographic walk of households and within-household randomization might do.
		People are asked to provide some SES-data.
	- From the (self-selected!) applicants, a saturation sample of 8-16 or so people is constructed, who are invited to participate.
- Set-up:
	- People from around Bremen (to reduce travel cost) are lodged together.
	- Meals are prepared together both to forge understanding, and to reduce cost.
		Citizens can suggest recipes, staff will provide ingredients.
	- Sessions are held in office rooms available at Jacobs University or Uni Bremen.
	- No or only a small (50-100 EUR) honorarium is granted, but all costs (including local travel) are covered.
		On-site child-care is offered.
		Crosby et al suggest a “decent day’s wages” as per diem, but I may not be able to fund that \cite[loc. 1899]{CrosbyNethercut-2005-aa}. -->

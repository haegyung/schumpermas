<!-- # Abstract -->

<!-- The respectful give and take of deliberative citizen participation is expected to change political views, though in which way, and how to measure it, is less clear.  -->
<!-- On the one hand, conventional survey research offers rigorous and advanced analytics, but is marred by deductive operationalizations and often falls short of a convincing measure of communicative rationality.  -->
<!-- Qualitative approaches, on the other hand, leave much to the researcher's discretion, and risk conflating a measure of deliberative quality with the researcher's substantive theory of justice or reason. -->

<!-- As a mixed method, Q methodology is better suited for the study of deliberative democracy. -->
<!-- It offers a holistic, and operantly defined, yet quantitatively rigorous view on political subjectivity. -->

<!-- Using data gathered before and after the 2014 CiviCon Citizen Conference on taxation, hosted by the author, I suggest several approaches to measure deliberative quality using Q methodology. -->
<!-- At the week-long conference, 16 diverse, self-selected citizens were tasked to design a tax system "from scratch", choosing among possible combinations of base schedule.  -->
<!-- They participated in learning phases, deliberated in moderated small group and plenary sessions, met with experts and held a concluding press conference. -->
<!-- Before and after the conference, citizens sorted 79 statements on taxation and economics according to their subjective viewpoint. -->

<!-- Following traditional Q methodology, sorts were factor analyzed to extract ideal-typical viewpoints shared by participants.  -->
<!-- Before the conference, citizens expressed resentful, radical and moderate viewpoints, including some apparent inconsistencies between beliefs, values and preferences on taxation.  -->
<!-- After the conference, citizens shared decommodifying, pragmatic and critical viewpoints and displayed a simpler, lower-dimensional structuration of viewpoints. -->

<!-- Such results are meaningful and encouraging for the use of Q in deliberation, but fall short of testing a treatment effect, because before- and after-factor models are extracted and rotated separately. -->
<!-- To tease out the effects of deliberation, I therefore also apply a newly developed 2-dimensional Q analysis (Q-2D), based on three-mode Principal Components Analysis (nPCA) by Tucker and Kroonenberg. -->
<!-- On the one hand, results indicate that, after considerable computation and graphical transformation, the effects of deliberation can be meaningfully interpreted using Q2D.  -->
<!-- Participation in the Citizen Conference appears to increase substantive consistency of political viewpoints, seemingly meeting a demanding standard for deliberative democracy.  -->
<!-- On the other hand, a unified longitudinal factor model may also unreasonably restrict the change of subjectivity during deliberation.  -->
<!-- Analyzed separately, there is some evidence that before and after factor models are, in fact, incongruent. -->

<!-- Alternative analytical approaches to Q data in empirical deliberative democracy research are discussed. -->

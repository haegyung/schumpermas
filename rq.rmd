<!--    - Draft completed by **2014-01-31** -->


Such a difference $\Delta$ between "raw" and "enlightened" thinking,
beliefs [@Caplan2007] and preferences [@Fishkin2009] is worth knowing for several reasons:

1.  There may be *agreeable*, doable but hypothetical taxes, which may (Pareto)-improve over current taxes [@Harberger1974] or may be fairer [@Rawls-1971] and more sustainable [@Solow1956], including a [@Mill1848; @McCaffery2002; @Frank2005a; @Seidman1997], a [@George1879; @Buiter1988] and a [@Friedman1962].
    By comparison, existing taxes appear unnecessarily wasteful, inequitable and unsustainable.[^oecd-taxes]
    <!-- COMMENT MN wÃ¼rde dieses Wissen schon so eingespeist? Bias? -->

    These suboptimal tax regimes may present democratic sovereigns with needlessly harsh tradeoffs between efficiency, equity, sustainability and other competing ends.
    The means of an intact mixed economy [@MusgThet1959; @Stiglitz2011] may consequently erode or even force retrenched welfare states into "permanent austerity" [@Pierson2002; @StreeckMertens2010] as it becomes harder for them to reconcile planned allocation and market exchange through taxation.

    Public confusion about taxation may be a contributing factor, or even a sufficient --- but not a necessary --- condition for the non-existence of these supposedly superior taxes.

2.  Progressivity in tax, especially, may hinge upon an enlightened, "new understanding of tax" [@McCaffery2005], as the historic mainstay of redistribution --- the [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- withers away in the face of its inherent contradictions [@McCafferyHines2010].
    People may understand tax *systematically* different from how they would under (more) ideal speech, which may cause them to choose less effectively progressive taxes than they otherwise might, or otherwise inadvertently act even against their material self-interest.
    Additionally, the difference between raw and enlightened thinking about tax may, in itself, depend on the socio-economic status of citizens.
    Taken together, such socially structured and structuring differences in understanding tax may contribute to further, or perpetuate existing social inequality, even under nominal political equality.

3.  The aggregative and representative institutions of liberal-pluralist democracy may be partly outmatched by the vexing complexity [@Merton-1968-aa] and tightly concentrated interest [@Olson-1971-aa] of late market economies, such as in taxation, violating both their input and output legitimacy [@Scharpf1997] as well as basic democratic prescriptions for "enlightened understanding" [@Dahl-1989-aa].
    Empirical political sociology bears out such popular dissatisfaction, not with democracy it self, but with incumbents, enamored by special interest, and inattentive to the public good [@NyeJr.1997; @Norris2011; @PutnamPharr-2000-aa].
    If such a "post-democratic" constellation [@Crouch2004] were to plague the polity in its thinking about tax, it may well affect other policy areas too.

[^oecd-taxes]: In the [oecd]{acronym-label="oecd" acronym-form="singular+short"}-world, those are varying combinations of pre-paid, proportional consumption taxes such as [vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"} and income taxes, often with different schedules for labor, capital and corporate incomes.
    Wealth taxes, often only on some asset classes, exist in some jurisdictions, but --- with the exception of local US property taxes --- are not a large revenue source.


## State of the field

This positive aspect of this thesis sits at the intersection of two fields of empirical research:

1.  Practical experiments with different deliberative fora on varying policy areas,
2.  Experimental and survey research about popular understandings of tax.

<!-- In the following, I briefly report key findings from these three fields and identify avenues for further research. -->

### Empirical Deliberation

#### Deliberative Experiments

Deliberative fora have been tried on a number of policy areas and places, including renewable energy in Texas (USA) [@LehrGuild-2003-aa], participatory budgeting in Porto Allegre [@CoelhoPozzono-2005-aa] (Brasil), nanotechnology [@Powell2008], electoral reform in British Columbia (Canada), policing and education in Chicago (Illinois) [@WarrenPearse-2008-aa], and city planning in Philadelphia (Pennsylvannia) [@Sokoloff2005].
They also vary in their institutional design [reviewed in @Fung-2003-ac].
These include several small-n, multi-day designs, such as Citizen Juries [@SmithWales-2000-aa] or Planning Cells [@Dienel-1999-aa], where a few randomly selected citizens hear expert witness and deliberate amongst themselves for a couple of days, all facilitated by trained, non-expert moderators and prepared by a balanced briefing book to draft a Citizen's Report or similar consensus recommendation.
The otherwise similar Consensus Conferences [@Einsiedel2000] are often (much) longer, feature extended learning periods and are typically held on highly technical issues.[^consensus_conferences]

[^consensus_conferences]: Consensus Conferences were first developed and hosted in Denmark by the Technology Assessment Board to collect informed popular input for regulating science and technology.

Deliberation has also been tried in large-n, shorter designs with a more quantitative methodology in [dp]{acronym-label="dp" acronym-form="singular+short"}s [@FishkinFarrar-2005-aa], where hundreds of randomly selected citizens receive issue books, deliberate in small, moderated groups and plenary sessions, hear expert witnesses and --- instead of reaching a consensus --- cast a secret vote or fill out a questionnaire, after the typically daylong deliberation concludes.
Often, these survey results are compared to answers provided by participants before the event, and/or to a control group of non-participants, allowing quasi-experimental within-subject or between-subject statistical inferences.[^drop_out]

[^drop_out]: Because participants can always drop out at will and will know when they are in the treatment condition, treatment cannot be strictly randomly assigned.

There is quite limited experience with long, large-n designs, including --- to my knowledge --- only the [@WarrenPearse-2008-aa] that spanned several months, and included several hundred participants who were offered stipends and accommodation, participated in extended learning sessions, attended public hearings and ultimately agreed to recommend a new electoral system (a [stv]{acronym-label="stv" acronym-form="singular+short"}) for the province [@Citizen-2004-aa].
<!-- MN true, but it failed? -->

<!-- TODO include tables from google doc. -->

Across these different designs and purposes, deliberative fora have been shown to improve knowledge of the subject matter in question, to change --- but not bifurcate --- beliefs [@Fishkin2009], to yield more orderly and orthogonal preferences structures [@Farrar2003] and to boost a sense of political efficacy or mutual trust even among disempowered citizens [@Karpowitz2009].

These encouraging findings on the capacity of deliberation to strengthen democratic rule notwithstanding, much of deliberative practice may be criticized for often focusing on the immediate, tangible and remaining "confined to the realm of neighborhood and locale" [@FungWright-2001-aa 17].
<!-- COMMENT MN das sind aber nicht die Hauptkriterien? -->
This includes not only the overtly "human-scale" democratic efforts [@Boggs-1997-aa 759] of participatory budgeting [@Sousa-Santos-1998-aa], city planning [@Sokoloff2005] or public stewardship of forests [@Cheng2005], but also the much-lauded [dps]{acronym-label="dp" acronym-form="plural+short"}, which have, even when they were about clearly large-scale issues such as the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} [@Fishkin2009] or renewable energy use [@LehrGuild-2003-aa] mostly shied away from the very structured choices and remote abstractions which policy must engage.
These [dps]{acronym-label="dp" acronym-form="plural+short"} have, for example, demonstrated that more people prefer [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} enlargement and more people would be willing to pay a premium for renewables [@Fishkin2009 157], but did *not* ask --- and probably not deliberate on, either --- whether the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} was an [oca]{acronym-label="oca" acronym-form="singular+short"}, and if not, what fiscal complements might have to be implemented [for example, @Mundell1961], or by which process *competing* renewable energies should be chosen, especially if they depend on economies of scale and network effects [for example, @Krugman-1990-aa].
Clearly, these are only two haphazardly selected examples of abstractions ([oca]{acronym-label="oca" acronym-form="singular+short"}) and choices (infant industry regulation) relevant to these topics, but equally clearly, someone, somewhere in the democratic process has to make these calls.
<!-- %fishkin quote in the above is K2010 -->

Some of these more technocratic considerations may be rightly relegated to experts, but for others --- including the abstractions of tax --- this may not be possible or desirable as discussed in the above.
In terms of @Landwehr2010, [dps]{acronym-label="dp" acronym-form="plural+short"} may not be sufficiently "coordinative" to be fully deliberative, and not only because they do not enforce a collectively binding decision [-@Landwehr2010 377].
Absent abstractions, "coordinativeness" suffers because the policy options (for example, "faster [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} expansion") in which preferences are expressed [-@Landwehr2010 375] are ill-defined (for example, *what kind* of european integration?).
If such expressed preferences are allowed to detach from ontologically given policy options (for example, currency union with our without fiscal complements), people can effectively "exit" from substantial agreement [@Landwehr2010 377]:
"deliberators" can just talk, which may still be desirable, but stretches the concept too thin [@Thompson2008 502].
<!-- %Or, in the words of \cite[2]{Moore2011} ``the broadly democratic idea that people ought to have equality of opportunity to contribute to deliberation on matters that affect them is undermined by the huge and manifold inequalities in knowledge that are necessary for the effective analysis, regulation and management of complex social and technological problems'' -->

To show its stripes --- or limits (!) --- deliberative democracy must be tried on such highly structured choices and abstract issues, too.
<!-- %COMMENT MN notwendigkeit der verbindung mit Entscheidungskompetenz? -->
So far, with the notable exception of some Danish (small-n) Consensus Conferences and the (large-n) [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"} [on its complexity, @Blais2008], such applications are lacking in empirical experiments with deliberation.
If deliberative practice continues to blank out governing abstractions and structured choices --- the very stuff of the modern world and its political rule --- it risks moving "in a defensive and insular direction, laying bare a process of conservative retreat beneath a facile rhetoric of grassroots activism" [@Boggs-1997-aa 759].[^drawing_delib]

[^drawing_delib]: A comically naive example of such retreat comes from Piombino, Italy, where schoolchildren were "involved" (sic!) in urban renewal of the town piazza:

    > "After school trips (...) they had to make drawings of how the piazza should look.
    > These often very colorful and joyful drawings were exhibited and also put on the website of the town."

    Praises @Steiner2012 [29]:
    "In this way, children learned a good lesson about practical politics with a very concrete case of policy-making" (sic!).
    These and other exercises in "involvement" may be pedagogically or otherwise valuable, but *emancipatory* deliberation they are not.
    In fact, the example of children seems awfully revealing as an operative metaphor for this kind of "deliberative" citizen:
    let them draw cute pictures, or busy themselves with otherwise inconsequential activities, so that they feel heard.
<!-- %in a different, more positive vein, \cite[4f]{Boswell2013} describes such deliberative designs as concerned with `` `low politics', where the stakes are lower, the glare of publicity less pronounced and the local knowledge of citizens more prized. -->
<!-- we could also be infavor of this, simply as a kind of societal glue -->

<!-- really add this as a completely new reason for my diss: the concern that deliberation might be watered down, professionalized to the degree where it becomes just marketing.
elisabeth clemens maybe? some other books at ssha -->


#### Academic Reflection

These and other deliberative fora have also received ample academic reflection.

One strand of positive research treats deliberation as the *independent* variable, investigating its effects (including @Bachtiger2005 on legislatures, @Hibbings2002 on power differentials or @Jackman2008 on better-grounded judgements).
<!-- %fishkin 1991, niemer 2002, Hansen 2004, Schneiderhahn und Kahn 2008 all do effects -->
In a similar vein, [@Steiner2004] studied in how far deliberatively reached decisions "correspond to criteria of social justice" [@Steiner2012 13], by which they seem to mean a utilitarian maxim [@Bentham1789] or the @Rawls-1971ian difference principle [@Steiner2012 95].[^steiner_v_rawls]

[^steiner_v_rawls]: @Steiner2012 presents a questionable summary of @Rawls-1971:
    > This principle states that in a political decision the most disadvantaged social groups should profit the most [@Steiner2012 95].

    He finds it expressed when a parliamentarian says:

    > The government's priority must be to help those who have the greatest difficulty in paying rather then spreading it evenly across the range.

    The difference principle actually states that "social and economic *inequalities* are to \[...\] be to the greatest benefit to the least advantaged members of society" [@Rawls-1971 266], a complex and conditional claim to moral validity that is characteristically degraded in both the operationalization and the coded snippet.

In other work, deliberation is the *dependent* variable, investigating its causes (including @Steiner2004 on institutional aspects or @Steiner2012 [13] on issue polarization).
Similarly, [@Landwehr2010] compare how the *discursiveness* and *coordinativeness* of parliamentary debates and citizen conferences on regulating embryonic stem cell research impacts resultant preference change, their proxy for deliberation.
Employing a more sophisticated and theory-grounded operationalization than most, @Landwehr2010 [377] analyze speech acts to code for arguing (for example, "to claim") and bargaining (for example, "to offer").
<!-- %developed in Holzinger 2001, also Niemeyer. -->

Lastly, researchers simply seek to operationalize deliberation.
For instance, [@Stromer-Galley2007] suggests a coding scheme, including "reasoned opinion expression" when people provide "a definition, a reason for holding the opinion, an example, a story, a statistic, or fact, a hypothetical example, a solution to the problem, further explanation for why the problem is a problem, an analogy, \[...\] or any further attempt to say what they mean or why they have taken the position that they have".

These academic reflections all try to abstract away the substantive issues at stake in the respective deliberative encounters.
Social scientists, here, as often, are loath to get caught in first-order conflicts over, say, school policy:
"\[...\] measuring the factuality or quality of reasoning was deemed unnecessary" [@Stromer-Galley2007 10].
This impulse is understandable, even commendable:
Social scientists are, by definition, in the business of explaining the second-order social conflict *over* normative and positive first-order questions [compare @GutmannThompson-2004-aa 12] and must generalize from the particular to build or test social theory.
Yet, since deliberation is a *discourse* ethic [@GutmannThompson-2002-aa 153], it is difficult to analyze without the actual, domain-specific discourse.
The operationalizations employed vary widely, ranging from the crudely statistical [@Steiner2012] [^count_interruptions] to the quick-and-dirty semantical [@Steiner2012] [^dqi_def] to promisingly speech-act linguistic [@Landwehr2010].

[^count_interruptions]: Summarizes @Steiner2012:
    "It is noteworthy that of the 1,027 speech acts, only 5 were interrupted by other participants, which indicates a calm and not boisterous atmosphere during the experiments" [-@Steiner2012 47].

[^dqi_def]: "\[O\]ur [dqi]{acronym-label="dqi" acronym-form="singular+short"} defined a sophisticated level of justification as having a certain complexity in the sense that an argument is justified with more than one reason and that these reasons are logically linked with the postulated outcome" [@Steiner2012 64].

The [dqi]{acronym-label="dqi" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- even in @Steenbergen2003's more exacting formulation --- and other such operationalizations "can be applied easily and reliably to a wide range of deliberative contexts" [@Steenbergen2003 22], but that very decontextualization makes it hard to adjudicate whether really, universal validity was discussed, let alone reciprocally acclaimed.
I share the uneasyness of "critical theorists and postmodernists" [@Steiner2012 11] with this measure of quality of deliberation --- though I do not think you have to be either to object, nor for the same reasons.[^postmodern_criticism_of_dqi]

[^postmodern_criticism_of_dqi]: [@King2009] criticizes that coded interpretations are presented as objective fact, rather than inter-subjective.

Rather than *how many* justifications were given in total, or *how often* people referred to counterarguments [@Steenbergen2003 29], I want to know whether these reasons corresponded in *substantive terms to those they disagree with*.
I provide a hypothetical exchange from deliberating taxation to illustrate my point:

<!-- TODO fix dialogue -->
**Foundationalist**
^[Inspired by the Philosophy of Robert [@Nozick1974].]
I believe that everyone should be entitled to incomes generated from uncoerced exchange with others.

**Social Democrat**
^[Not very inspired, and by no one in particular.]
Yeah, obviously we are not going to take away all of a person's income, they should be entitled to it, but maybe we'll take some of it because we need that for education.
That's not going to hurt them.
<!-- COMMENT MN social democrats/socialists will also always want to use taxation to disempower the powerful or the rich -->

**Georgist**
^[Inspired by the Philosophy of Henry [@George1879]]
I agree there may be something inviolable about owning the value added in free exchange with others.
But, Foundationalist, do you think that should also extend to owning unimproved land and natural resources?
It seems to me that *no one* has really created these values, and whoever reaps rents from them does so *only* because of the coercive powers that be.

Formally speaking and under [dqi]{acronym-label="dqi" acronym-form="singular+short"} coding, both Social Democrat and Georgist refer to Foundationalist's argument, yet their speech acts are of strikingly different quality.
Social Democrat, rather sloppily, reiterates the argument and proceeds to balance it with another good (education) and suggests a compromise.
We can see how the dialogue would proceed;
Foundationalist --- presumably deontologically bound to inviolable property --- would refuse to trade off property against opportunity.
<!-- %FIXME is maybe deontic the correct adjective some of the time? -->
Talking past one another, Social Democrat and Foundationalist may not have exchanged, let alone agreed on universal validity claims.
By contrast, Georgist --- maybe provisionally --- embraces the foundationalist's argument and points to an unexpected implication *in foundationalist* terms.
It is much harder to see how their dialogue would proceed;
presumably, Foundationalist would not --- ex ante --- have been open to large-scale land reform or taxation (as Georgism implies), and may not much warm to the idea.
Still, she may find it necessary to either clarify her position further, or to concede Georgist's point, because his may just be the "forcelessly forceful" better argument.
Foundationalist and Georgist are grappling with the formulations and implications of what *may* become a universally acceptable moral claim, and in so doing, have crept a little closer to communicative rationality.

Crucially, this kind of Habermasian adjudication cannot be done in the abstract;
researchers have to look for ideal speech in *substantive* terms as in this case, a foundationalist theory of property.

By abstracting away the actual arguments from a normative theory vested in their force, these researchers, as @Steiner2012 concedes, "take the position that large parts of the Habermasian version should be relaxed" [@Steiner2012 150].
For @Steiner2012, "the crucial point should be that participants in a political debate acknowledge that others also have reasonable arguments
\[...\]
If this is accomplished, the other side is humanized" [-@Steiner2012 150].
This may well be true and important research, especially for divided societies on which @Steiner2012 here reports, but it stretches the concept of *communicative action* too thin.
<!-- TODO refer to this is the kind of backstop argument for deliberation; it reduces the risk for civil war -->

To be sure, there may be such a loosely-defined thing as "deliberation" --- distinct from "debate"and "discussion" [@Landwehr2010 384] --- and we should study its antecedents and consequences, as much of the above-cited research does.
In this vein, deliberation raises positive questions:
What "middle-range theories" associate antecedents and consequences [@Mutz2008]?
To the extent that this deliberation is a normative project at all, it espouses a *consequentialist* outlook:
deliberation is good, because it leads to "more public-spirited attitudes;
more informed citizens;
greater understanding of sources of, or rationales behind, public disagreements;
a stronger sense of political efficacy;
willingness to compromise;
greater interest in political participation;
and, for some theorists, a binding consensus decision" [@Mutz2008 524].

Habermas prescription for communicative action, again, is different.
<!-- %COMMENT MN aber worÃ¼ber wird bei H. delibieriert? Ã¼ber normen, nicht Ã¼ber policies -->
<!-- counter here: correct, but the only way to discuss norms in a meaningful way in the modern world is with regard to concrete policies; that's what the world offers us. Aalso, as we'll see, much of the below *is* actually about norms.-->
Communicative action is not a positive statement about causes and effects open to falsification, because it poses a *regulative* principle [@Kant1781], which "is unachievable in its full state, but remains an ideal to which, all else equal, a practice should be judged as approaching more or less closely" [@Mansbridge2010a 80].
Communicative action is also not a consequentialist ethic, but deontological, because "it has the force to legitimate" [@Habermas2008 147] --- or even teleological, because "reaching understanding is the inherent telos of human speech" [@Habermas-1984 287].
As such a normative political theory, communicative action cannot be operationalized into a set of treatments.
Just because you subtract power, inequality, disrespect [@Steenbergen2003], even "irrationality", or any other combination of procedural criteria from communication does not necessarily make it ideal speech --- even though the inverse may well be true, as these and other criteria may be *necessary* conditions for ideal speech.
Legitimating collective choice through ideal speech *is* the irreducible, final reason of @Habermas-1984' political theory whose achievement can only be found in substantive arguments.

Still, to thereby "simply define" deliberation as "intrinsically good" does not, as @Mutz2008 [524] suspects, render "empirical research irrelevant".
As @Steiner2012 [13] reminds us, the "level of deliberation" must be "measured and not merely assumed".
By definition, the normative impetus of communicative action cannot be falsified, but we may find that at any given time, any given people under any given circumstances, *fail* to meet Habermas' exacting standards [@Thompson2008 499].
Such failures can serve "as indicators of *contingent* constraints that deserve serious inquiry and \[...\] as detectors for the discovery of specific causes for existing lacks of legitimacy" (@Habermas2006 [420, emphasis in original], compare also @Thompson2008 [502]).
<!-- %Indeed, empirical researchers ``should focus on those features of the practice that directly relate to the fundamental problem deliberative theory is intended to address: In a state of disagreement, how can citizens reach a collective decision that is legitimate?'' \cite[502]{Thompson2008}. -->

If we accept this more demanding definition of deliberation as the venue in which our approximating of ideal speech is ascertained, as I here wish to do, our research designs must be focused on argumentative substance.
Others have done this, and have produced encouraging insights.
[@Ratner-2008-aa] interviewed [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"} members after the fact, and found that most members considered Habermas' validity claims honored --- especially compared to the proper tragedy that was the following referendum campaign in which many [ca]{acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short"} alumni participated.
While the analysis is based on interviews, not process data, it maintains the Habermasian standard and does not spare the reader qualitative data, including snippets recounting substantive disputes over electoral design.
[@GutmannThompson-2004-aa], too, reporting on deliberations over medical rationing, stick to their (quasi-Habermasian) standard, argumentative reciprocity, and offer examples of how it is met or violated in substantive arguments over health care.

Some may object that this approach collapses the procedural theory of democracy into a substantive theory of justice, and that it consequently requires researchers to take sides.
This neither need, nor ought to be so.
@Habermas-1984' *Communicative Action*, much like @Rawls-1971' contemporary *Theory of Justice* is neither purely procedural, nor substantive, but elegantly posits the *discursive conditions* under which substantive claims ought to be made.
The contrast between procedural and substantive theory, here, as elsewhere, is misleading:

> This kind of public philosophy would avoid the dichotomy that has come to dominate contemporary discussions of political theory, which poses a choice between basing politics on a comprehensive conception of the good, on the one hand, or limiting politics to a conception of procedural justice, on the other.
> We can and should avoid choosing either of these approaches exclusively.
> --- @GutmannThompson-2004-aa [90]

Consequently, researchers need not take sides, nor follow (dubiously legitimate) expert rule [@Blok2007; @Haas1992].
Emphatically, "alternative conceptions of the common good" [@Cohen-1989-aa 23] are possible and desirable.
Researchers must, however, familiarize themselves deeply with the issue to be deliberated, penetrate the discursive fluff and distortions to relentlessly unearth causal and moral disagreements which reasonable people may have over the issue.
Researchers can then analyze their rich, qualitative, ideally process data in terms of these expected disagreements, to assess in how far the observed deliberation lives up to the standards of communicative action.
Ideally, deliberators will struggle to formulate universal validity claims to express and resolve these very disagreements.
In short, researchers need not have a position on the issue, but they *must have a stake* in the abstractions, disagreements and uncertainties plaguing the issue.

Communicative action on taxation, in particular, must be analyzed in substantive terms for these reasons.
Tax is fraught with deep-seated causal and moral disagreement.
To test whether people in any given deliberation on tax really have exchanged universal validity claims to --- potentially --- resolve these disagreements, their actual communication must be compared to some ideal standard of expected arguments, tentatively identified by researchers.

### Misunderstanding Taxation

Survey and experimental researchers have investigated how people misunderstand taxation and its abstractions.
[@McCafferyBaron2003], tracking the heuristics and biases research program [@KahnemanEtAl1982] suggest that voters fall short of @VonNeumannMorgenstern1944-rationality in their choice of tax:
they incorrectly believe that taxation has a trivial, "flypaper" incidence [@McCafferyBaron2004b], they favor (indirect) taxes not labeled or not visible, they fail to aggregate different taxes --- especially the proportional or regressive [payroll]{acronym-label="payroll" acronym-form="singular+short"} and [vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- confuse progression in absolute and percentage terms and inconsistently prefer bonuses over penalties.
Worried, [@McCafferyBaron2004] suspect that politicians may exploit these and other misunderstandings and that current tax systems may be suboptimal as a result of voter irrationality.
They also suggest that people may overestimate effective progression, and that tax regimes may, as a result, be less redistributive than voters intend and believe them to be [@McCafferyBaron2004].

In a similar vein, [@SausgruberTyran2011] show that people mistake the nominal incidence of a tax with its effective incidence on the buyers and sellers in a taxed market transaction.[^always_markets]

[^always_markets]: By definition, taxes in a market economy --- a pleonasm --- must *always* be levied as some potential market exchange occurs.
    This is straightforward for income and consumption taxes, where the earning and spending transactions are taxed, but also holds for wealth taxes and even other instruments of expropriation (such as inflation).
    Taxation always requires some real (or imputed) market valuation of the given tax base, which in turn necessitates an actual or hypothetical transaction between market participants.
<!-- %add reference to liquidity effects -->
In their laboratory experiment, participant buyers frequently tax sellers more than themselves, forgetting that --- under perfect competition, especially factor rent and price flexibility --- buyers and sellers will share any given tax on their transaction irrespective of the nominal incidence.[^tax-lse]

[^tax-lse]: This according to the [tax-lse]{acronym-label="tax-lse" acronym-form="singular+short"}.
<!-- %add reference to perfect competition conditions -->

Under the resulting "tax-shifting bias" [@SausgruberTyran2011], or, equivalently "flypaper theory of taxation" [@McCafferyBaron2003], participant buyers often choose suboptimally high taxes on sellers, which they end up paying (partly) themselves.
@SausgruberTyran2011 furthermore find that participants are less likely to tax-shift if they are given accurate information on tax burdens exogenously and if they have experienced its income-reducing effects in the laboratory marketplace.
Troublingly for deliberative democrats, they also find that (albeit minimally defined) initial deliberation does not reduce tax-shifting, but that it "makes initially held opinions more extreme rather than correct" [-@SausgruberTyran2011 164], corroborating concerns for (deliberative) group polarization [@Sunstein1991].

These are rigorously researched and disconcerting findings that have not received nearly the attention they deserve from welfare state scholars and other political economists.
These and other misunderstandings of tax may constitute partial, possibly sufficient --- but not necessary --- causes for changing tax regimes and constricted, or retrenched welfare states.
<!-- %note the absence of arbitrage mechanisms -->

These are also --- much like the sponsoring heuristics and biases program --- no definitive, comprehensive list of misunderstandings, but an evolving, loosely connected set of relatively low-level cognitive effects.
More research is needed:

-   how do people (mis)understand some of the broader and more complex issues bearing on taxation, such as economic growth, savings rates or government and market failures?
-   how --- if at all --- do the suggested low-level cognitive heuristics and biases filter up to the very structured choices of base, schedule and timing of taxation asked of the [oecd]{acronym-label="oecd" acronym-form="singular+short"} polities?

As these pressing questions are addressed to develop a coherent account of social change from misunderstanding taxation, research
designs as those by @McCafferyBaron2004 or @SausgruberTyran2011 may well face two kinds of limits:

1.  The complexity of higher-order considerations may overwhelm both designs.

    Laboratory models in behavioral economics as those by @SausgruberTyran2011 have the distinct advantage of directly testing the misunderstood causal effect in question (in this case, [tax-lse]{acronym-label="tax-lse" acronym-form="singular+short"}), and rendering participants with an immediate experience of the effect (here, lower incomes).
    As the causal effects in question become more complex --- for example, liquidity or employment decisions under different taxes --- laboratory models face ever harsher tradeoffs between internal and external validity [for a review and dissenting opinion, see @Jimenez-Buedo2010].
    Trivially, economy-wide choices --- for example, between a [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} and [pct]{acronym-label="pct" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- are very hard to model in the laboratory;
    if they were any easier, economic policy would be a non-issue.

    The within-subject designs of cognitive psychology as those by @McCafferyBaron2004 also offer great internal validity when the heuristics and biases are low-level.
    Participants rate their agreement with, or the truth, of several statements they are presented with.
    Experimenters vary the context or wording of substantively identical statements to identify contradictions or mental shortcuts within the answers of individual participants.
    @McCafferyBaron2004 provide supposedly "de-biasing" information as within-subject treatments.
    The problem with higher-level concerns --- say, whether to tax income or consumption --- is that equivalent de-biasing treatments would eventually need to be an introductory economics course, covering at least the circular flow in the economy, some macroeconomics of aggregate demand and the Haig-Simons identity of income.
    As the required syllabus grows, it not only becomes impractical for participants with limited time and patience, but it also ignites a combinatorial explosion of necessary treatments to figure out just which (of supposedly many) insights from the de-biasing did the trick.

2.  More problematically yet for the deliberative-minded researcher, both designs cannot problematize, let alone resolve, any *remaining* substantive disagreements over taxation and its economic abstractions.
    Both behavioral economics and cognitive psychology stipulate that there is *a* ([vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-)rationality, and merely chronicle whatever human deviations from it they find.
    Again as with the heuristics and biases research program in general, researchers and deciders must be aware of these deviations from rationality in tax, but these deviations do not add up to a theory, much less an account of social change in taxation or democracy.
    We know that @VonNeumannMorgenstern1944 say one (internally consistent) thing, and other homo sapiens mostly something else, but we learn little about the conditions of this divergence, let alone ways to reconcile it.

    Things get even thornier for a heuristics and biases research program of tax, when higher-level concerns are introduced and --- as they likely will --- turn out to be controversial.
    @McCafferyBaron2004 or @SausgruberTyran2011 posit expert rationality against their participants, and, whenever they differ, find their participants at fault.
    This works well enough for disentangling percentage and absolute tax burdens, and tolerably for demonstrating a tax-shifting bias[^flexible_prices],
    but leaves the researcher empty-handed when faced with genuine disagreement *between* experts, or challenges as the legitimacy of expertise.
    To be sure, there *may* well be *the* [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-rational, human-nature-compatible optimal taxation, that renders all other proposals regrettable misunderstandings --- but this hypothesized agreement and its communicative conditions must be tested, not axiomatized.
    The heuristics and biases research program can inspire a sociological account of misunderstood taxation, but it cannot bring it to its conclusion.
    When faced with inevitably controversial higher-level issues such as the choice between a [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} and a [pct]{acronym-label="pct" acronym-form="singular+short"}, both cognitive psychology and behavioral economics will smack of expertocracy and remain fruitless because they allow no recourse to a second-order theory [@GutmannThompson-2004-aa 125] --- such as Habermasian deliberation --- to resolve disagreement.

[^flexible_prices]: Tellingly, @SausgruberTyran2011 already take pains to remind readers that [tax-lse]{acronym-label="tax-lse" acronym-form="singular+short"} only holds when factor rents and prices are fully flexible --- a condition that is as controversial as is it is difficult to verify, even after 60 years of macroeconomic debate about little else [@Wapshott2011].


## Research Questions

The deliberative experiments on taxation proposed here builds on these two strands of research as much as it probes its limits:


1. Taxation as a *Case*.
  <!-- does deliberation work -->
  A deliberative forum on taxation, including its structured choices and abstractions, adds another --- yet rare --- experiment on a technocratic and complex policy issue to the empirical record.
  From this perspective, deliberation is the research topic, and taxation is a *case* to test the limits and capacities of this prescription for political *rule*.[^tax_franzi]
2. Deliberation as *Method*.
  <!-- can it resolve the confusion and contradictions within tax -->
  Lastly, deliberating taxation will provide data to better understand possible misunderstandings of tax and, thereby, clarify remaining controversies over it.
  From this perspective, optimal taxation and popular deviations therefrom are the research topic, and deliberation provides the *method* to investigate, or even resolve these differences in a normatively attractive manner [@Rawls-1971; @Habermas-1984].
<!-- %add visualization of the above and below paragraph? -->

[^tax_franzi]: Taxation is a good case, because --- as Franziska Deutsch succinctly noted in 2011 --- it affects everyone, but most people know little about it.

These two research topics all fold into the aforementioned research question:
how will different people understand taxation differently, if they participate in a deliberative process *closer* to the ideals of communicative action than the status quo of representative democracy?


## Hypotheses

Both research questions, about 1) the remaining disagreements about tax and 2) the ability of deliberative democracy to cover abstract and structured issues can be rolled up into one set of hypotheses.

@Fishkin2009 suggests that deliberation increases knowledge, and changes preferences as a function of such knowledge gain.
Similarly, I hypothesize that people will gain in knowledge about taxation, including resolving some systematic misunderstandings of concepts and causal relationships, some variants of which are already documented [@McCafferyBaron2003; @Caplan2007].
I furthermore hypothesize that *as a function* of these knowledge gains, people will change their preferences on the desired base and schedule of taxation.
Additionally, deliberation will increase self-assessed autonomy and competence of participants, and they will find the presented alternatives of base and schedule more meaningful.
Learning interventions will further drive knowledge gain and improve self-assessments, but --- if it is sufficiently balanced --- *will not* interact with attitude change.

*italics*


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that ssdthe `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

That's great except other *formatting* does not seem to work.

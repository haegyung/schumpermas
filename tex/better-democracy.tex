	\emph{``Parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests;
which interests each must maintain, as an agent and advocate, against other agents and advocates;
but parliament is a deliberative assembly of one nation, with one interest, that of the whole;
where, not local purposes, not local prejudices ought to guide, but the general good, resulting from the general reason of the whole.
You choose a member indeed;
but when you have chosen him, he is not a member of Bristol, but he is a member of parliament.''}\\*

\section{Deliberative Theory}

%wikipedia:
%Deliberative democracy differs from traditional democratic theory in that authentic deliberation, not mere voting, is the primary source of legitimacy for the law.

%wikipedia:
%"Im Zentrum der Theorie der deliberativen Demokratie steht das Legitimationsideal der öffentlichen Beratung politischer Fragen.
%Der Kern dieser Theorie ist daher eine Kritik der liberalen Theorie der Demokratie, vor allem der rein aggregativen Sichtweise und der Übertragung des Marktmodells auf die Politik."

%wikipedia on Habermas re:
%deliberation
	%wikipedia:
%Diskurse vollziehen sich öffentlich bzw.
%in der Öffentlichkeit:
	%„Die Öffentlichkeit lässt sich am ehesten als ein Netzwerk für Kommunikation von Inhalten und Stellungnahmen, also von Meinungen beschreiben“ (Habermas 1992:
%436).
%Öffentlichkeit ist also kein vorgefundener Raum, sondern muss durch ein interessiertes Publikum und durch kommunikativ handelnde Teilnehmer erst hergestellt werden.
%Öffentlichkeit besitzt bei Habermas drei Funktionen:
	%Erkennen und Wahrnehmen gesamtgesellschaftlicher Probleme
	%Thematisieren und Herantragen dieser Themen an die Entscheidungsträger im politischen Zentrum
	%Kontrolle des politischen Zentrums.
	%Die nichtstaatlichen wie nichtökonomischen Akteure der Zivilgesellschaft (oder:
%der „zivilgesellschaftlichen Öffentlichkeit“) als „(\ldots) das Substrat jenes allgemeinen, aus der Privatsphäre gleichsam hervortretenden Publikums von Bürgern, die für ihre gesellschaftlichen Interessen und Erfahrungen öffentliche Interpretationen suchen und auf die institutionalisierte Meinungs- und Willensbildung Einfluß nehmen“ (Habermas 1992:
%444) sollen diese Funktionen übernehmen (nicht näher thematisiert werden soll hier die sog.
%„vermachtete Öffentlichkeit“, in der sich etwa finanzstarke Lobbygruppen wiederfinden würden).
		%key point:
%you can have civil society, but only in the deliberation, that is the control of power.

%wikipedia on cohen
	%Joshua Cohen, a student of John Rawls, outlined conditions that he thinks constitute the root principles of the theory of deliberative democracy, in the article "Deliberation and Democratic Legitimacy" in the 1989 book The Good Polity.
%He outlines five main features of deliberative democracy, which include:
	%An ongoing independent association with expected continuation.
	%The citizens in the democracy structure their institutions such that deliberation is the deciding factor in the creation of the institutions and the institutions allow deliberation to continue.
	%A commitment to the respect of a pluralism of values and aims within the polity.
	%The citizens consider deliberative procedure as the source of legitimacy, and prefer the causal history of legitimation for each law to be transparent and easily traceable to the deliberative process.
	%Each member recognizes and respects other members' deliberative capacity.

%This can be construed as the idea that in the legislative process, we "owe" one another reasons for our proposals.

%wikipedia on cohen
	%Cohen presents deliberative democracy as more than a theory of legitimacy, and forms a body of substantive rights around it based on achieving "ideal deliberation":
	%It is free in two ways:
	%The participants consider themselves bound solely by the results and preconditions of the deliberation.
%They are free from any authority of prior norms or requirements.
	%The participants suppose that they can act on the decision made;
%the deliberative process is a sufficient reason to comply with the decision reached.
	%Parties to deliberation are required to state reasons for their proposals, and proposals are accepted or rejected based on the reasons given, as the content of the very deliberation taking place.
	%Participants are equal in two ways:
	%Formal:
%anyone can put forth proposals, criticize, and support measures.
%There is no substantive hierarchy.
	%Substantive:
%The participants are not limited or bound by certain distributions of power, resources, or pre-existing norms.
%"The participants…do not regard themselves as bound by the existing system of rights, except insofar as that system establishes the framework of free deliberation among equals."
	%Deliberation aims at a rationally motivated consensus:
%it aims to find reasons acceptable to all who are committed to such a system of decision-making.
%When consensus or something near enough is not possible, majoritarian decision making is used.
	%In Democracy and Liberty, an essay published in 1998, Cohen reiterated many of these points, also emphasizing the concept of "reasonable pluralism" – the acceptance of different, incompatible worldviews and the importance of good faith deliberative efforts to ensure that as far as possible the holders of these views can live together on terms acceptable to all.[9

\input{./tex/pluralist-vs-deliberative.tex}

%note this odd thing:
%my justification of tax and deliberation is Rawlsian (liberal), but deliberative democracy is NOT liberal, and it often has communitarian overtones (positive rights) -- that is very odd.
%I need to get into that.
%maybe the solution is that communitarianism vs individualism are just extreme answers to an inherently contingent human nature:
%just whether we are individuals, or groups is what needs an institutionally mediated answer, it's not either or, it's depending on \ldots
%and maybe deliberation and tax do just that.

%Rosenberg's / Toqueville's school as democracy and vice versa is the operative metaphor, this is profound.

%``I will listen'' means to the strong democrat not that I will scan my adversary's position for weaknesses and potential trade-offs, nor even (as a minimalist might think) that I will tolerantly permit him to say whatever he chooses.
%It means, rather, ``I will put myself in his place, I will try to understand,  I will strain to hear what makes us alike, I will listen for a common rhetoric evocative of a common purpose or a common good.'' ''

\section{Deliberative Models}
%There's a bit of a problem with Fishkins DP design;
%he doesn't actually want a coherent movement in one direction (no homogeniziation, no polarization).
%that's kind of a problem with my hypothesis for PCT-preference.

%There are some things that I see different than Fishkin does, or I think my project would take a different perspective.
%His are usually pretty mundane topics, and pretty simple items that he tests in terms of knowledghe.
%The deliberated topics are topics that CANNOT be decided by expert (health care rationing, etc.).

    % * standards (Fishkin covers that)

%The view subscribed to here is that of an engineer.
%You look at what you've got.
%You consider the dysfunctions you know about.
%You add an element (a moderator) that you suspect might help.
%This is the key difference to juries.
%Juries are not moderated.
%Deliberative Fora are.
%Maybe cite the Magnolia piece ("play as it leads".)
	%This is the key difference to juries.
%Juries are not moderated.
%Deliberative Fora are.

%Also consider:
%groupthink, and other dysfunctions (Kuran, Noelle-Neumann), and how to counter this.
%It seems, what would be important would be GOOD moderators, a place that is curiously underinvestigated as someone wrote in the special issue.

%Sanders (emphasis added):
%``democrats [\emph{need}] to listen as well as to talk in their deliberation''

%This design combines the electoral part of democracy with the talking part.
%(this is Chambers 2003:
%308)

%Cite that Sanders makes a good point, pointing out the dysfunctions that juries display.
%It's a good, if somewhat outdated review.
%Will need to find fresher literature.
%Sanders 369:
%``I should say that I am not entirely against deliberation.
%But I am against it for now:
%I think it is premature as a standard for American democrats, who are confronted with more immediate problems''.
%Sanders 370:
%``The invitation to deliberate has strings attached.
%Deliberation is a request for a certain kind of talk:
%rational, contained, and oriented to a shared problem.
%Where antidemocrats have used the standards of expertise, moderation and communal orientation as a way to exclude average citizens from political decision-making, modern democrats seem to adopt these standards as guides for what democratic politics should be like.
%And the exclusionary connotations of these standards persist.''
%Sanders 372:
%``What is fundamental about giving testimony is telling one's own story, not seeking communal dialoge.
%Although hooks refer to the development of a ``common literacy,'' this voice is common to a group that is usually excluded from the discourse of the dominant, and the voice that contributes to a ``common literacy'' is posed by hooks in opposition to, and as a criticism of, this dominant discourse.
%There's no assumption in testimony of finding a common aim, no expectation of a discussion oriented to the resolution of a community problem.
%Testimony is also radically egalitarian" the standard for whethera view is worthy of public attention is simply that everyone should have a voice, a chance to tell her story.''
		%This might be a problem.
%If the rich have a story to tell, too, we might end up with pluralism as we started.

		%Mutz (2008) is all about how it is important to make deliberative democracy falsifiable.
%I'm doing it, a little.
%(Note the link between falsifiability and substantive standards of justice.
%You can't do without it.)
%Also, my cop-out is:
%a LITTLE fairer will be fine.
%You can't make falsifiability into a latently affirmative business, if you really fall for SES creeping in (as Olaf always insisted it would).
%So you've gotta get some kind of balance here.
%Cite Offe (via Bosch) on his brilliant charicature on how a theory CAN innundate itself against criticism.
%It may be helpful to simply point out here that what holds for deliberation (is it falsifiable?, nah, maybe not so much with substantive standards) ALSO holds for pluralism (are these, in the economists language, ``revealed preferences'')?
%(revealed preferences works for the market, not sure whether that belongs in here)

%Deliberation is "still in large part a critical and oppositional idea" (Bohman and Regh 1998, p 422:
%as cited in Mutz 528).
%I totally agree.

%Thomson points out that deliberation was unlikely to ever fully negate inequality, but also (Thompson 2008):
%``Empirical research that simply reinforces the general conclusion that deliberation falls short of the standards of equality is therefore not very illuminating.
%Research that shows specifically what conditions and changes might mitigate inequality can be useful.
%Even more valuable, and less common, is research comparing the inequalities in deliberative forums with inequalities in other political settings.
%Because so much of democratic politics is pervaded by inequality, the more fundamental question is comparative:
%To what extent do deliberative forums satisfy various standards of equality more or less effectively than other political processes?''

%Also:
%``[Deliberative] Theory challenges political reality.
%It is not supposed to accept as given the reality that political science purports to describe and explain.
%It is intended to be critical, not acquiestent".

%Also:
%``Some researchers have assumed that they can dispose of deliberative theory by showing that political discussion often does not produce the benefits that theorists are presumed to claim for it.
%They extract from isolated passages in various theoretical writings a simplified statement about one or more benefits of deliberative democracy, compress it into a testable hypothesis, find or (more often) artificially create a site in which people talk about politics, and conclude that deliberation does not produce the benefits the theory promised and may even \ldots'' (tbc)

%So there are (also in Thompson) several reasons why consensus may not even be desirable
%1) deliberative democrats disgagree on whether they want it (Gutmann and Thompson 2004):
%``Exposing and even intensifying disagreemnents may be desirable in many circumstances.
%''
%2) ``it is difficult to distinguish consensus from compromise'' (Steiner et al 2004:
%91-92, as cited in Thompson 2008)

\end{quote}

%Rosenberg 2007:
%Rosenberg has the radical inter-subjective formulation that I think I'm looking for:
	%6:
%``In this deliberative conception, equality and autonomy require each other.
%On the one hand, equality is a necessary precondition of autonomy.
%It is only in a cooperative exchange between equals that the self-expression and critical selfreflection required for the self-reflective construction of one’s understandings and interests is possible.
	%10 Where the self dominates, self-criticism truncates and narrows.
%Where the other dominates, self-expression is suppressed.
%In either case, the self that is constructed is a distortion and any true autonomy is compromised.
%On the other hand, equality requires autonomy.
%Deliberative equality is equality of effective participation.11
	%10:
%Developmental psychology raises further questions regarding the adequacy of deliberative theorists’ characterization of cognition.
%In the deliberative democracy literature (and in most social psychological research), cognition is typically conceived as a universally shared set of distinct skills or capacities.
%Following the work of Piaget27 and Vygotsky,28 the research on cognitive development offers a more integrative and differentiated view of cognition.
%Cognition is not regarded simply as a matter of calculation or arranging representations, but more essentially as a constructive activity.
%This is understood in pragmatic terms, that is, with reference to an individual’s attempt to operate on the world around her.
%In this attempt, the individual conceives of the acts, items and people involved in term of the role each plays in her purposive activity
	%12:
%In this sense, the research suggests that deliberations be regarded as remedial institutions

%I have doubts about the deliberative poll.
%Can it be upgraded, enhanced to cover substantive justice, a classroom and Rosenberg?

%``Deliberative fora must not be regarded simply as empty stages that provide a venue for the realization of citizenship;

%The operative metaphor here is that of a school, but of particular kind.

%``Here, care must be taken to recognize individual differences in cognitive and emotional development and to consider the different ways in which deliberations may have to be institutionalized to meet their individual needs.

%In this regard, they have a tendency to continue to characterize cognition as an essentially psychological attribute, one that reflects a basic and universal human nature.

%Here are list of impacts that Deliberation may have on the public:

	%Habermas, on the other hand seems to argue that deliberators can't get into the business of government anyway.
	%"communicative action, is action oriented to reaching understanding" (Habermas 1996, Norms and Facts)

	%Social coordination through communicative action is possible, Habermas argues, in societies characterized by ‘strong archaic institutions’ and ‘small and relatively undifferentiated groups’ (Habermas, 1996, p.
%25).
%This is because communicative action always takes place against the backdrop of a shared lifeworld, which in traditional societies provides ‘a reservoir of taken for granteds, of unshaken convictions that participants in communication draw upon in cooperative processes of interpretation’ and from which ‘processes of reaching understanding get shaped’ (Habermas, 1987, pp.
%124 and 125, respectively).

	%However, coordination through communicative action becomes improbable in post-traditional societies, due to the emergence (strictly related to rationalization and modernity) of self-centred action based on strategic calculations.
%In these societies, ‘in which unfettered communicative action can neither unload nor seriously bear the burden of social integration falling to it’ (Habermas, 1996, p.
%37), law emerges as a functional necessity exactly to ‘lighten the tasks of social integration for actors whose capacities for reaching understanding are overtaxed’ (Habermas, 1996, p.
%34).

	%6It should be noted that some of the discourses which are produced in the informal public sphere conform poorly to the ‘gentlemen’s club’ model featured in some theories of deliberation (i.e.
%rational, poised and articulate), which, according to critics, ‘involves communication in the terms set by the powerful’ (Dryzek, 2000, p.
%70), and resemble much more the ‘agonistic’, partisan discourses of a trial setting.
%Groups do not seek to persuade each other but seek to influence the court of public opinion by forcefully asserting the issues, values and interpretations that they believe should be binding for everybody, sometimes even through ‘sensational actions, mass protests, and incessant campaigning’ (Habermas, 1996, p.
%381).

	%This characterization shares with critics of deliberation, in particular with Carl Schmitt’s Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy (1985), and Habermas’ own earlier work (for example, 1989), a stance of low expectation about the possibility of deliberation in formal settings, and it sees action aimed at reaching understanding as more likely to occur in the informal public sphere, where the preferences of ordinary citizens are still malleable, pragmatic constraints as to what is possible and feasible are less pressing, and the possibility for civil society groups to build communicative power by articulating moral alternatives to the

%"In contrast to this and other aggregative conceptions, the ideal of de- liberative democracy says that in voting it is the role, perhaps the duty, of democratic citizens to express their impartial judgments of what conduces to the common good of all citizens, and not their personal pref- erences based on judgments of how measures affect their individual or group interests"

	%Bingo377:
%here's the disagreement with Fishkin:
%" No reasonable conception of democracy would advise us to vote without thinking at all about how alternatives might affect relevant in- terests (whether our personal interests or the common interest).
%This would be irrational.
%In this regard what distinguishes deliberative from aggregative conceptions is not deliberation per se, nor the fact that one involves voting but the other does not (contrast Przeworski, DD2).
%Nor is it even that the deliberative view involves discussion while the aggregative view does not.
%"

	%There's also a more expansive list of other rights that deliberative democracy requires, including some basic economic and educational opportunities (see 381)

	%I think there's really two groups of reasons for deliberation:
		  %1st lack of information (cooperation problem, this is Kaplan) (this is the "Millian argument" as cited in ibid.
%383
		%2nd   * lack of cooperation in substantive terms (bare majority rule aint enough) (I find ibids definition on 383 too shorthand;
%it's not just about minority protection, it's about an awful lot more than that).
		%3rd   * legitimacy (ibid 383) because people understand when they loose out, why the lose out
		%   * 4th:
%make principled arguments, "extends peoples imagination" (Goodin as cited ibid), "engages moral sentiments" (Rawls as cited ibid).

		%   * 5th:
%autonomy by enlightenment:
%(sunstein as cited in bibid 384 "Political autonomy can be found in collective self-determination, as citizens decide, not what they 'want,' but instead who they are-what their values are and what those values require.
%"21

	%ibid 388 calls this the difference between procedural and epistemic views of democracy.Procedural views emphasize fairness of demo- cratic procedures, whereas epistemic views emphasize substantive jus- tice of outcomes.
%A pure procedural conception of democracy has no standard independent of the voting procedure itself to determine the justice of outcomes.36 A pure epistemic conception says that justice is entirely independent of procedures for deciding what is just, so that the procedure that best approximates substantive justice is itself right (le- gitimate or just).

	%There's hope for disagreeing, not tolerating stuff:
%ok:
%401:
%"Rawls's ideal of public reason then responds to the "fact of reasonable pluralism." Reasonable pluralism-not pluralism per se-defines the pa- rameters and the reach of public reason.
%This means three things (at least).
%first, Rawls's idea of public reason does not rely on autonomy or any other "comprehensive" account of the human good;
%nor does it depend on an account of the origin of moral duty (in reason, emotion, or God's wis- dom or will.) The idea that autonomy, God, utility, human perfection, or some other comprehensive value, is a condition of justice and the hu- man good must be given up within public reasoning, for these values cannot provide bases for agreement on a common good among demo- cratic citizens "

	%402:
%"Whereas expression of such unreasonable views is to be tolerated, their effects are to be contained by society.
%There is no requirement that they be respected or accommo- dated by public reason "

	%So here's the punch line (this needs to be argued very carefully):
%I think an economy, and in particular a democracy rooted in self-intersted are suboptimal and inequitable.

%Second, public opinion in mass society may be open to manipulation because of the public's low information levels.
%If people have little background information, then foregrounding particular facts may be persuasive when people have no idea of the broader context.
%Clean coal advocates make a powerful case for the benefits of clean coal compared to dirty coal, but the mass public has little idea that clean coal is much dirtier than natural gas (as well as other alternatives like renewable energy).
%Selective invocation of true facts (such as that clean coal is cleaner than dirty coal) without a context where those facts can be compared to others (how clean coal compares to other energy alternatives) can allow advocates to manipulate opinion.10 Third, when people have little information they may easily fall prey to misinformation.
%Even when contrary information was in the public domain, assertions that Iraq was responsible for 9/11 apparently carried weight when it was shrouded in the protective glare of national security.
%Fourth, a strategy of manipulation that is probably more common than misinformation is strategically incomplete but misleading information.
%If one argument based on true but misleadingly incomplete information has high visibility through expensive advertising and the counter to it never gets an effective audience, then the public can be seriously misled.
%Fifth, another key strategy of manipulation is to "prime" one aspect of a policy, making that dimension so salient that it overwhelms other considerations.
%In effect, a candidate or policy advocate changes the terms of evaluation so that the issue on which his or her side does best becomes the one that is decisive.11 Read more at location 124   • Delete this highlight

%The idea of microcosmic deliberation is to take a relatively small, face-to-face group which everyone has an equal chance of being part of, and provide it with good conditions for deliberating on some policy or political issue.
%Citizens Juries, like Deliberative Polls use public opinion research methods to gather a sample to deliberate.
%But the Citizens Jury is more akin to a single discussion group in that the size is comparable to that of a modern jury-twelve or perhaps eighteen or twenty-four.34 A benefit of such a group is that it can continue to meet in a local community for an extended period, sometimes for several days or on successive weekends.
%The "jurors" hear testimony, call witnesses, ask for evidence, and at some point come up with recommendations to some local or governmental authority.
%The limitation of the process is that with such small numbers it is not possible to establish the statistical representativeness of the deliberating group.
%Citizens juries are too small for there to be a scientific basis for connecting their conclusions to the hypothetical informed opinion of an entire society, to what the country would decide if it were better informed-even though the results of Citizens juries are often represented in that way.
%However, the now extensive experience in both the United States and the United Kingdom with Citizens juries adds to our picture of citizen competence with complex policy issues-once citizens find themselves in a social context that supports deliberation.35 Read more at location 843   • Delete this highlight

%Gutman, the book:

%1) Its first and most important characteristic, then, is its reason-giving requirement.
%The reasons that deliberative democracy asks citizens and their representatives to give should appeal to principles that individuals who are trying to find fair terms of cooperation cannot reasonably reject.
%The reasons are neither merely procedural (“because the majority favors the war”) nor purely substantive (“because the war promotes the national interest or world peace”).
%They are reasons that should be accepted by free and equal persons seeking fair terms of cooperation.Read more at location 163   • Delete this highlight

%2)  second characteristic of deliberative democracy is that the reasons given in this process should be accessible to all the citizens to whom they are addressed.
%To justify imposing their will on you, your fellow citizens must give reasons that are comprehensible to you.
%If you seek to impose your will on them, you owe them no less.
%This form of reciprocity means that the reasons must be public in two senses.
%First, the deliberation itself must take place in public, not merely in the privacy of one’s mind.
%In this respect deliberative democracy stands in contrast to Rousseau’s conception of democracy, in which individuals reflect on their own on what is right for the society as a whole, and then come to the assembly and vote in accordance with the general will.2 The other sense in which the reasons must be public concerns their content.
%A deliberative justification does not even get started if those to whom it is addressed cannot understand its essential content.
%It would not be acceptable, for example, to appeal only to the authority of revelation, whether divine or secular in nature.Read more at location 177   • Delete this highlight

%4) This continuation of debate illustrates the fourth characteristic of deliberative democracy—its process is dynamic.
%Although deliberation aims at a justifiable decision, it does not presuppose that the decision at hand will in fact be justified, let alone that a justification today will suffice for the indefinite future.
%It keeps open the possibility of a continuing dialogue, one in which citizens can criticize previous decisions and move ahead on the basis of that criticism.
%Although a decision must stand for some period of time, it is provisional in the sense that it must be open to challenge at some point in the future.

%Mutual justification means not merely offering reasons to other people, or even offering reasons that they happen to accept (for example, because they are in a weak bargaining position).
%It means providing reasons that constitute a justification for imposing binding laws on them.
%What reasons count as such a justification is inescapably a substantive question.
%Merely formal standards for mutual justification—such as a requirement that the maxims implied by laws be generalizable—are not sufficient.
%If the maxim happens to be “maximize self-or group-interest, ” generalizing it does not ensure that justification is mutual.
%Something similar could be said about all other conceivable candidates for formal standards.
%Mutual justification requires reference to substantive values.
%We can see more clearly why mutual justification cannot proceed without relying on substantive values by imagining any set of reasons that would deny persons basic opportunities, such as equal suffrage and essential health care.
%Even if the reasons satisfied formal standards, they could not constitute a mutual justification because those deprived of the basic opportunities could reasonably reject them.
%Denying some persons suffrage is a procedural deprivation that is inconsistent with reciprocity:
%we cannot justify coercive laws to persons who had no share in making them.
%Similarly, denying persons essential health care is a substantive deprivation that cannot be justified to the individuals who need it.

%Such justifications may constitute part of the moral reasoning to which some citizens appeal, but the reasoning must survive the test of actual deliberation if it is to ground laws that actually bind all citizens.
%Moreover, deliberation should take place not only in the private homes of citizens or the studies of philosophers but in public political forums.
%In this respect, deliberative theory proposes a political ideal that is process-dependent, even if its content is not exclusively process-oriented.Read more at location 1854   • Delete this highlight

%The criterion of mutually respectful reasoning helps distinguish a reciprocal perspective from another kind of moral perspective, which bases itself on the criterion of impartiality.
%Reciprocity stands between prudence, which demands less from justifications, and impartiality, which demands more.
%Impartiality insists that reasons be impersonal.
%It requires citizens to suppress their own personal perspectives and partial projects when setting social policies and procedures.
%The prime example of an impartialist approach is utilitarianism.
%In practice, it favors expert decision-making and implies that the medical professionals in DesertHealth should have the final say as long as their judgment is consistent with general professional opinion.
%The preferred impartialist method is neither bargaining nor deliberation, but demonstration, which aims as far as possible to establish the truth of a comprehensive moral view.
%In the face of moral disagreement, impartiality tells citizens and officials that they should affirm the view most consistent with the true morality as determined by impersonal justification.
%There is no further moral need for mutual respect or for actual political deliberation.
%The trouble with impartiality is that it does not take moral disagreement seriously enough.
%More precisely, it fails to provide a satisfactory way to deal with the moral disagreements that inevitably remain on many issues when expert opinion on the technical and medical problems or the demonstration by a comprehensive moral philosophy such as utilitarianism are complete.
%In the face of a fundamental moral disagreement such as funding fetal-tissue research, expensive organ transplants, or experimental diagnostic tests such as PUREPAP, the impartialist approach can declare only one side (or no side) correct.
%If one side is correct, it provides no reasons for recognizing moral value on the other side.
%It therefore offers no way, other than agreement, for the other side to respect the decision on moral grounds.Read more at location 2742   • Delete this highlight

%And, “Love, by its very nature, is unworldly, and it is for this reason rather than its rarity that it is not only apolitical but antipolitical.”39 But while reciprocity does not aim at encouraging love among citizens, it does aim at developing some degree of respect among citizens.
%“[W]hat love is in its own, narrowly circumscribed sphere, ” Arendt concluded, “respect is in the larger domain of human affairs.” Respect is less personal than love.
%It does not require intimacy or closeness, or even an admiration of a person’s achievements or particular qualities.

%When the People Speak
%   * 66:
%There are, Fishkin notes, “normally strong disincentives for mass public opinion to be very deliberative.” 11 These can range simply from what economists would call the “search costs” involved in becoming suitably informed about public issues to the collective-action problems, also much emphasized by economists, that promote “free-riding” by most of the public on the relatively small number of individuals who are willing to invest their scarce time and energy (and money) into the demands of genuine republican citizenship.

%      * Mass participation

%Fishkin is no utopian.
%Indeed, a very important part of his argument is that one must choose among the horns of his trilemma.
%There is, therefore, the sad realization that “the fundamental principles of democracy do not add up to such a single, coherent ideal to be appropriated, step by step.
%… Achieving political equality and participation leads to a thin, plebiscitary democracy in which deliberation is undermined.
%Achieving political equality and deliberation leaves out mass participation.
%Achieving deliberation and participation can be achieved for those unequally motivated and interested, but violates political equality.” 13

%BINGO:
%71 Furthermore, much political theory under the influence of economic modelsof reasoning in particular proceeds from a methodological fiction:
%this is .
% the methodological fiction of an individual with an ordered set of coherent preferences.
%This fiction does not have much relevance in the political world.On complex social and political issues, more often than not, individuals may have views and wishes but no ordered set of preferences, since the latter would imply that they would be enlightened not only about the preferences but about the consequences and relative merits of each of their preferred choices in advance.
%It is actually the deliberative process itself that is likely to produce such an outcome by leading the individual to further critical reflection on his already held views and opinions;
%it is incoherent to assume that individuals can start a process of public deliberation with a level of conceptual clarity about their choices and preferences that can actually result only from a successful process of deliberation.
%Likewise, the formation of coherent preferences cannot precede deliberation;
%it can only succeed it.
%Very often individuals' wishes as well as views and opinions conflict with one another.
%In the course of deliberation and the exchange of views with others, individuals become more aware of such conflicts and feel compelled to undertake a coherent ordering.

%Deliberative Democracy - Diffidence By Design?\\ Red Flags and Opportunities

%\section{The Problem:
%\\Democratic Institutions Are Underperforming}

%William H.
%Hastie (1904-1076), the first African American Justice on the U.S.\ Supreme Court warned us that ``Democracy is not being, it is becoming.
%It is easily lost, but never finally won''.

%And so, indeed, the global proliferation and sustaining of popular rule in the West notwithstanding, our democracies are today faced with new challenges \citep{Huntington-1991-aa}.

%Value research points to increasing disaffection of voters, not with democracy as a system of rule, but with the institutions and performance of real-existing, sustained democracies \citep{Dalton-2004-aa}
%\footnote{
	%Dalton (ibid.) has pointed out that voter disaffection may in fact be regarded as democratically desirable, if we hold it to be indicators of critical citizen oversight of governance.
%This assumption --- that changing evaluation criteria may be for the better of democracy --- has some merit, but does not warrant inaction.
%Except to a very cold-hearted, and epistemologically narrow mind of rational choice, dwindling voter turnout (ibid.) must be alarming everyone that, if this ``snake [does not] shed its skin, [it may well] perish.'' (Antoine de Saint-Exup\'ery, The Little Prince).
%In any case, the material deficiencies and inequalities of our world point to political systems that are not beyond improvement.}.

%Explanations for voter disaffection and perceived underperformance vary, invoking amongst others ``government overload'' \citep{HuntingtonInternational-Affairs.-1968-aa}, ``post-material'' or ``emancipative'' change and dimensions of values \citep{InglehartWelzel-2005-aa}, mind-boggling ``reflexive modernization'' \citep{BeckGiddens-1994-aa} or a democratic deficit inducing ``denationalization'' {Zurn-2000-aa}.

%I employ here \citeauthor{PutnamPharr-2000-aa}'s \citeyearpar{PutnamPharr-2000-aa} model to explain decreasing citizen confidence in government and political institutions.
%As relevant ``boundary conditions'', they list increased \emph{information} about the flaws of the political process ``post-Watergate'', and heightened \emph{evaluation criteria} due to either, or both, rising and diverging expectations.
%Citizens then assess the performance of representative democratic institutions, which is in turn a product of the \emph{capacity and competence}, the \emph{social capital} and \emph{fidelity} of the governors.
%The capacity and competence refers to the \emph{ability} of governments to choose and to implement policies in the interest of their citizens, highlights a routinized decision-making process as such and points to a systemic level of analysis.
%Fidelity is an individual-level determinant of government performance, focusing on the incidental misconduct.
%Social capital affects performance as a ``civic lubricant'' as an infrastructure, or network of generalized trust between individuals.

%\section{The Proposal:
%Inclusive, Egalitarian, Rationality-based Deliberative Democracy}

%\paragraph{How Deliberative Democracy is a Solution} Deliberative designs are pitted to tackle underperforming political systems from all of the above-mentioned angles.
%On the performance side, turning away from aggregative, or even bargaining decision-making to democratic rule based on reason (rather than power), is held to advance the sophistication of decisions (capacity/competence) as well as to strengthen an orientation towards the common good \citep{Cohen-1989-aa} and egalitarian, \citeauthor{Rawls-1971}ian \citeyearpar{Rawls-1971} justice (social capital, fidelity).
%On the side of the citizens, deliberation, by virtue of its inclusivity further increases information while at the same time putatively improving their evaluation criteria through reasoned discussion.

%Deliberative democracy can be argued to \emph{respond} to a crisis of democracy, but at the same time \emph{transcends} the epistemology of its diagnosis.
%It entails two paradigmatic shifts:
%for once, preferences are no longer held to be essentially \emph{pre-social} dispositions of a utility-maximizing individual, but subject to and product of reasoned deliberation on the common good.
%An evaluation by citizens of government performance, thereby becomes somewhat superfluous.
%Secondly, deliberative democracy is a project in \emph{direct democracy}, dissolving the very representative divide between the governed and the governors, fundamental to the diagnoses of crisis.

%\section{The Game:
%\\Setting the Scene of the Political Process}

%Political decision-making is here understood always as a response to a collective action problem of some sort, that is, the otherwise under-provision of a public good, in the broadest possible sense\footnote{The (neo)liberal undertones of this conceptualization of politics of that which the market does not take care of are, if reluctantly so, acknowledged.}.
%Where uncoordinated cooperation through exchange (markets) fails and hierarchical coordination (guardianship, see further \citealt{Dahl-1989-aa}) is illegitimate, people have to agree on a process by which they will reach the necessary \emph{collectively binding} decisions.

%By constructing the political process from its outcomes, it is --- axiomatically, really --- implied here, not that the political process would in any way be overloaded \citep{CrozierHuntington-1975-aa}, but that it is dramatically under-resourced to address the challenges postindustrial society faces.
%This shift in focus on \emph{the ability} of collective decision making bodies is based on an idealist, utopian hypothetical of a potent polity which can choose and implement \emph{any} collective action, unless otherwise constrained by individual rights.
%This stands in stark contrast to the more widely, if hardly explicated, weary notion of a greatly constrained community that, if at all, can collectively improve only at the margin, and rather then addressing, outsources hopes for progress to the market, devolves them to local governance or rejects them as ``input overload'' (ibid.).

%\subparagraph{Capacity} By capacity, I understand the \emph{ability} of democratic rule \emph{to act} in the interest of the people, that is, in the last instance, the ability to enforce collectively binding decisions.
%This reflects \citeauthor{Zurn-2000-aa}'s (\citeyear{Zurn-2000-aa}:
%188) notion of congruency between the social and the political spaces, where inputs and outputs of both realms must always occur at the same level.
%In simpler words:
%an input incongruence occurs (for example, disenfranchised illiterates), where people are affected by a political decision (or non-decision) of their own polity, in the making of which they had no say and an output incongruence (for example, international tax competition) is given when a polity is affected by a dynamic, over which it has no jurisdiction.

%\subparagraph{Competence} By competence, I understand the ability to \emph{reason} on and \emph{identify} \emph{policies} that are in the interest of the people, and, conversely, those, that are not --- and why.

%The distinction between capacity and competence --- in reality as in the following discussion --- is not as clear-cut as here stipulated.
%Where capacities are constrained, even a competent discussion is likely to anticipate which decisions are impossible to collectively enforce, and thereby retract on other ``second-best'' solutions.
%Conversely, a capacity to organize a public good hardly makes sense abstracted from, or in the absence of a competent understanding of its very possibility.
%The distinction therefore serves rather to structure the argument from different, albeit not entirely orthogonal angles.

%\section{The Pitfalls:
%\\Deliberative Democracy's Red Flags}

%\paragraph{Framing the Question}In the following I provide a discussion of the capacity and competence inputs to the performance of deliberative democratic institutions, leaving aside the empowering (information and evaluation criteria of the citizens) and civic (social capital, fidelity) dynamics, which I hypothesize to be much more unambiguously positively.
%I expand on \citeauthor{PutnamPharr-2000-aa}'s \citeyearpar{PutnamPharr-2000-aa} understanding of capacity and competence.

%\subsection{Deliberative Capacity:
%Are we Missing the Elephant in the Room?}

%\begin{quote}
%	\emph{If they can get you asking the wrong questions, they don't have to worry about the answers.}\\
%	Thomas Pynchon
%\end{quote}

%Surveying the existing proposals for and empirical accounts of deliberative designs, one cannot help but notice that the overwhelming majority of them are small in scale, both in terms of geography as well as issues discussed.
%This may simply lie in the incremental progressing of its innovation.

%In the following, I argue that the small scale of currently existing deliberations is not merely epiphenomenal, but essentially grounded in a flawed discourse, that it is consequential for deliberative prospects, and can make for a dysfunctional, if hegemonic, political process.

%In their proposal for ``Empowered Deliberative Democracy'' \citeauthor{FungWright-2001-aa} (\citeyear{FungWright-2001-aa}:
%17) explicitly suggest what underlies much of the current designs:
%\begin{quote}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item A focus on \emph{specific, tangible} problems
%\item Involvement of \emph{ordinary people} affected by these problems and officials \emph{close} to them
%\item The deliberative development of solutions to \emph{these} problems.
%\end{enumerate}
%(ibid., all emphases added)
%\end{quote}

%In a similar vein, even the ``bigger'' deliberative designs of Planning Cells and Consensus Conferences are believed to best suited for issues that are publicly significant and \emph{relevant to the lives of lay citizens} (\citealt{HendricksonTucker-2005-aa}:
%84, emphasis added).

%What are consequences of this ``diffidence by design''?

%\subsubsection{Small is Inadequate}

%Before discussing concrete examples, a positivist ``outing'' of modernity may be in order:
%In the following analyses it is assumed that, whenever functional differentiation gives rise to a sophisticated division of labor and accumulation of capital (as is the case on all example societies), the antecedent complex, and ever far-reaching web of social and economic interdependencies will affect the provision of public goods, too.

%\paragraph{Chicago Devolution}The almost microscopic devolution in the Chicago Police Department (CPD) or the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) are insightful examples plagued by crass incongruences of political, social and economic spaces.
%While not explicitly deliberative formats, both innovations sought to improve inclusion, dialogue, and equality \citep{Fung-2003-aa}.

% The revamped CPD sought to cooperate with residents \emph{on a neighborhood}-level to identify and to fight --- not prevent --- crime herds.
%By its very focusing on police ridings, it made larger-scale, macro determinants of crime invisible, and outside the scope of debate:
%income inequality, or zoning laws, to name just two of the factors otherwise so glaringly discernible in Chicago, itself almost the epitome of a decaying inner city\footnote{Both of these factors, incidentally, would not even need a truly macro perspective to become potentially visible, as they are already visible on a metropolitan level.}.

%In Public Schooling, Chicago reinvigorated \emph{school-based} Parent-Teacher Associations, re-trained and coached staff and teachers and installed systematic performance management ``by comparing their methods with those of \emph{similarly situated but better-performing schools}'' (\citealt{Fung-2003-aa}:
%124, emphasis added).
%No mentioning is made of comparisons with surrounding suburban Illinois or urban charter schools, which may have enabled an understanding of the structural factors influencing a school's success or may have exposed the gross differences in scholastic aptitude with students ``not similarly situated''.
%Or, one hypothesizes, such comprehensive analyses may even put the effect of school management in a humbling juxtaposition against other, more powerful macro-level factors.

%There is no reason to belittle the efforts of these brave \emph{Don Quixotes}, working and participating to improve their surroundings in the schools and police stations of Chicago.
%Many of them have demonstrated substantial results \citep{Fung-2003-aa}.
%But given the ``macro windmills'' grossly outmatching these deliberators --- windmills over which, under the current design they have no control or even mandated discourse --- they are destined to fail in their democratic decision-making.
%Congruency between inputs, that is, what deliberators can discuss and decide on, and the outputs, that is, the social and economic reality to which they respond, is violated.
%Even basic democratic criteria of accountability and responsibility for political decisions and outcomes (like the ``within-slum'' performance management) have no meaning in this context.

%\paragraph{Participatory Budgeting} Much lauded Participatory Budgeting (PB), pioneered in Porto Allegre, Brasil, is another example for the intricacies and dangers of deliberative devolution from a transition economy setting.
%Under PB, local community and organization representatives cooperate with city government in deliberative fora, both at the neighborhood level and in thematic groups.
%Using a sophisticated rating and decision procedure they allocate much of the city governments investments.
%Observer \citet{Sousa-Santos-1998-aa} notes how PB contributes to a ''counterhegemonic globalization'' by concentrating on special issues like land rights, urban infrastructure and drinking water in urban settings.
%He, like few other writers on deliberative designs and PB in particular, is aware of the resulting danger that PB projects remain ``Bean 'n Rice Works'', ``formulae for solving a few of the urgent problems affecting the popular classes, perhaps a less clientelist version than the traditionalist one, but no less imediatist and electoralist'' (\citealt{Sousa-Santos-1998-aa}:
%479).
%Also, he points to the threats posed to PB by the 1998 financial crisis in Brazil, and wonders whether PB will still be possible ``when the material results turn out to be less anchored in the immediate needs of the regions'' (ibid.:
%495) and how distributive justice will still be possible under increased functional differentiation

%\paragraph{Identity} Another way to look at the inadequacy of small-scale deliberation is to question the identity formation that undergirds it.
%As is often cited self-confidently, devolved deliberation is praised to be ``carved out of (\ldots) the realm of neighborhood and locale''(\citealt{Boggs-1997-aa}:
%751).
%Just some etymological intuition --- neighbor\emph{hood}, \emph{community} (living together), \emph{the local} people --- suggests a bias towards a smaller scale, identities of which, for some reason seem to be more valuable than others.

%Of course, a ``neighborhood'', for the most part --- except actual acquaintances --- is no more or less of an ``Imagined Community'' \citep{Anderson-1983-aa}, no less constructed and contingent \citep{Gellner-1983-aa} than a Nation State, or ``The International Community'', for that matter.
%``Mechanical Solidarity'' \citep{Durkheim-1893-aa}, the only kind that would justify the immediate, the local, has through multifaceted integration and functional differentiation long given way to ``Organic'' --- if any --- Solidarity, where interdependencies run far.
%And where modern technology has brought great mobility, locality, is, as Simmel \citeyear{Simmel-1917-aa} said (of boundaries) ``not a spatial fact with sociological effects, but a sociological fact which forms spatially".
%There is then no particular reason to focus on local policy making --- but highly problematic consequences, as is argued in the following.

%\paragraph{Macro-Level Abstractions} As the majority of theorists write, deliberation depends on a rational orientation towards the common good.
%To argue well, and with the public good in mind then, necessitates a good understanding of causal relationships ruling our social world.

%By its very definition, under modernity, these causal relationships are complex and the interdependencies run far.
%Good deliberation thus \emph{has to} transcend the immediate, the tangible and the local and to render accessible all the complex connections that functional differentiation binds.

%The described, excessively immediatist micro-focus is inadequate under modernity.
%It disallows deliberators both to understand, and to change all but a tiny portion of what determines their circumstances.

%An output incongruency arises.


%\subsubsection{Small is Uncritical}

%\paragraph{Freedom From vs.
%Freedom To} It was, and still is, the promise of deliberative democracy to transcend the old trade-off between freedom \emph{from} and freedom \emph{to}.
%Sadly, a deliberative democracy that does not render sufficiently accessible macro-level abstractions is likely to sustain the bias towards negative freedoms of liberal democracy, which \begin{quote} ``may make it very difficult to mobilize citizens to accomplish what they collectively value most positively, but these rights and powers do insure them from suffering from what they collectively value most negatively, i.e.
%tyranny --- whether exercised by a zealous minority or an intolerant majority'' (\citealt{Schmitter-2000-aa}:
%28) \end{quote}.
%Two things are important to note about deliberative democracy and a possibly sustained liberal bias.

%First, The micro-macro dichotomy and and the rift between negative and positive freedoms are related:
%negative freedoms are protected by \emph{individual} rights, which by their very definition assume, and guarantee a degree of independence from broader, macro-level interrelations.
%The right to property, to ``pursue happiness'', or even --- less obviously liberal --- to form a political association (\emph{or not to}), all protect the individual from a possibly imposing collective good (or evil)\footnote{The anti-totalitarian, humanist and protective impetus of liberalism are not to be belittled here.
%Enshrined negative freedoms are a great achievement, particularly in a country like Germany, where a frenzied, putatively common good has at least once brought untold sorrow.
%The lessons of this experience notwithstanding, it is held here, that the needs have shifted in post-industrial society:
%negative freedoms, for the most part (possible exception of privacy) is largely uncontested, and antecedent values and institutions are strong and deeply rooted.
%As modernization progressed, however, positive freedoms have not grown equally.
%Much of the postindustrial world sees rising income inequalities, and even more dramatically, decreasing social mobility.}.
%Positive freedoms, on the other hand, require \emph{collective} organization to reach desirable outcomes.
%This collective organization needs to be ``congruent'' over the social, economic and political sphere.
%In micro-level deliberations, as I have tried to show, this is easily not the case, tilting the balance towards negative freedoms.

%Secondly, and more critically, the liberal trade-off between positive and negative freedoms has important equity implications.
%The balance between positive and negative freedoms is highly consequential, for they are not equally valuable to everyone.
%To put it blandly, rich people, who have much to protect and little to gain from affirmative and redistributive policy, value negative freedom more and are skeptical of positive freedom.
%While poor people certainly hold most negative freedoms equally dearly as the rich, some of them (pursuit of happiness) may not have much practical meaning under dire circumstances and others (right to property) may be opposed to their re-distributional needs.

%The above-mentioned devolution in the Chicago Police Department is a intriguing example of promoting negative freedom in at least two ways.
%First, it renders the distributional determinants of crime (decaying, impoverished inner cities) invisible.
%Secondly, it focuses our attention and decision-making on crime, more specifically, an law enforcement, not prevention --- quite the essence of promoting negative freedom.

%\paragraph{No Spectres of Historical Materialism, But Politicization} This appraisal of positive and negative freedoms need not, and should not, lead us to \citet{Marx-1867-aa}.
%Essentializing economic status to bring about any ``[groupist] class for itself, rather than in itself'' \citep{MarxEngels-1848-aa} is clearly opposed to the deliberative spirit.
%But truly fair deliberation has to open up \emph{all} the large-scale interrelations (Marxist vulgo:
%structure) of modern society for debate, including the omnipresent implications of late international consumer capitalism.
%It has to overcome power, as much as it has to \emph{politicize} matters.
%In \citeauthor{Bluhdorn-2007-aa} (\citeyear{Bluhdorn-2007-aa}:
%313) words:
%\begin{quote}
%``Politicization is the realization that established social norms, social practices, and social relations are contingent rather than sacrosanct, that things could also be different and that citizens, individual and collectively, have political agency by means of which alternatives can be explored and implemented.
%This recognition that things could also be different has always been the igniting spark of the emancipatory-progressive movements, and politicization has always been their key strategy.''
%\end{quote}

%Wherever large-scale social relations are not understood, and opened up for deliberation, of course, no agency to change can be assumed.
%In a way, the still emancipatory-progressive movement of deliberation risks to neglect much of what \emph{could} be changed, over what \emph{can} be changed more easily, and locally.

%Where reason fails to include macro-level abstractions and enable comprehensive politization, it cedes decision-making ground back to power --- a game, in which in turn, the already powerful and rich will likely prevail.

%To be serious about equality then requires us to be very ambitious about reason.
%Otherwise, an input-incongruency may arise.


%\subsubsection{Small is Anti-Statist}

%\paragraph{Do-It-\emph{Yourself} Democracy} As a corollary of its liberal, somewhat uncritical bias, small-scale deliberation also tends to be anti-statist.
%Taking up some of the anti-authoritarian, anti-bureaucratic, anti-functional-differentiation impetus of post-'68 left counter-culture, progressive and new social movements, current deliberative efforts tend to focus on the immediate, tangible and ``confined to the realm of neighborhood and locale'', not just out of necessity, but out of conviction (\citealt{Boggs-1997-aa}:
%759).

%The very essence of Weberian (\citeyear{Weber-1958-ab} rationalized authority to enable collective action in the face of highly integrated economic production, embodied --- at least for the time being --- mostly in the state, thus comes under attack.
%This cherishing of ``human-scale democracy''over all else, the donning of a large, necessarily anonymous and formalized bureaucracy, Boggs (ibid.) rightly fears, may move democracy ``in a defensive and insular direction, laying bare a process of conservative retreat beneath a facile rhetoric of grassroots activism''.

%Perversely, the anti-authoritarian adage ``Keine Macht FÜr Niemand'' ('no power for anyone', \emph{Ton Steine Scherben}, 1972), applied to deliberation in the modern world --- at least in  the absence of anarchist revolution --- acts to \emph{conserve}, to sustain the status quo.

%\paragraph{The Elephant in the Room} Again, the old focus on ``autonomy'' in small-scale deliberation becomes visibly consequential only when looked at through the prism of social inequality:
%who stands to gain, who to loose from this focus?
%Clearly, like under a liberal basis --- essentially the same paradigmatic dichotomy --- the rich will rely less on a strong Weberian (\citeyear{Weber-1918-aa}) state, and the poor, while they may not understand it or reject its anonymous and sometimes authoritarian interfaces, rely on the state's exclusive capacity for affirmative action and redistribution.

%Boggs (\citeyear{Boggs-1997-aa}:
%752) goes one step further and even conspires that this revolt against the state may have hegemonically ``strategic value in a period of global interdependence and worsening social crisis''.

%\paragraph{Deliberation --- Successfully Failing?} Eliasoph's \citeyear{Eliasoph-2001-aa} flamingly polemic account of how an exclusive concentration on the do-able, the small-scale, the consequentially less political, creates dynamics of an outright ``Culture of Political Avoidance'' and escapism is enlightening.

%A more disinterested, and systematic explanation of this dynamic comes from the theory of \emph{Successfully Failing Organizations} where, when faced with excessively costly challenges, organizations may choose ineffective, but symbolic policies the failure of which cannot, and will not be systematically detected.
%Such examination and oversight of agents (governors), it is argued, is not desired even by principals (the governed), precisely because its likely revelation of failure would necessitate a greater allocation (vulgo:
%redistribution) of resources \citep{Seibel-1996-aa}.
%Failure then becomes successful in that it sustains the status quo, and those who have material stakes therein.


%\subsection{Deliberative Competence:
%Is it Doable?\\Words of Caution From Political Psychology}

%\begin{quote}
%	\emph{The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.}\\
%	Winston Churchill
%\end{quote}

%Churchill's quip is surely a conservative, non-egalitarian exemplification of representative democracy, and thereby not surprisingly at odds with deliberative projects.
%Still, proponents of deliberation haven reason to worry about citizens' competence.
%Recent research in political and cognitive psychology suggests, that it may not be so unproblematic to assume Churchill's skepticism away, particularly from an egalitarian perspective.

%That people likely and often do not think perfectly rational is nothing new:
%people have been found to frequently use ``quick and dirty'' heuristics, rather than complete cost-benefit analyses (\citealp{CohenMarch-1972-aa, Simon-1999-aa}, to name just a few).

%\paragraph{The Not-So-Common Sense} Recent research in political psychology suggests, that --- contrary to the bounded rationality assumption --- imperfect human reasoning may not only stem from remediable cognitive scarcity, but may be developmentally determined.
%Rosenberg (\citeyear{Rosenberg-2007-aa, Rosenberg-2002-aa, RosenbergWinterstein-2008-aa, Rosenberg-2003-aa}) has suggested a threefold developmental sequence and typology of \emph{sequential}, \emph{linear} and \emph{systematic} reasoning.
%His empirical accounts suggest that if any, only systematic thinkers will be able to meet the cognitive demands for reasoned arguments, and egalitarian free speech of deliberative democracy.
%Moreover, this cognitive competence was found not to be domain specific, and while people may regress to lower levels of competence under high loads or appropriate cues, they are unlikely to easily, if ever, achieve higher than developed levels.
%``Structurally (more and) less developed reasoning adults'' make then ``not only the adequacy of citizens' reasoning, but also their equality'' a problem for deliberative democracy (\citealt{Rosenberg-2007-aa}:
%12).

%This empirical finding resonates well with some anecdotal frustrations in deliberative settings, for example in participatory health administration:
%\begin{quote}
%``The tendency of citizens to construct their arguments in a way that is regarded as unstructured, combined with their focus on highly localized issues, makes their speeches appear unclear, emotional, disruptive or irrelevant to most representatives of the other sectors.
%Moreover, this style of speech tends to be associated with poorer and less educated people, and it is regarded as not only ineffective, but also virtually unintelligible''.
%\end{quote}

%The conclusion Rosenberg draws from this is as skeptical, as it is ambitious.
%He suggests that ``deliberations must be more than remedial, they must be sites for political education and development'' (\citeyear{Rosenberg-2007-aa}:
%13).
%If they fail, so will quality of reasoning in deliberation and equality.

%\section{The Critical, Feminist Response:
%\\The World Ain't a Positivist Machine}

%\begin{quote}
%	\emph{Das Ganze ist das Unwahre}\\
%	\emph{(The Whole is Falsehood)}\\
%	Theodor W.
%\citet{Adorno-1974-aa}, Minima Moralia
%\end{quote}

%Deliberative proposals in general, by virtue of their focus on reasoned arguments, have been charged to embody and essentially impoverished, positivist and thereby ``male'' outlook on the world, particularly from feminist critics \citep{Young-1996-aa}.
%The above discussion, expanding demands for a universal rationality and outright promoting macro-level abstractions is subject to the same criticism.

%A full-blown discussion of the epistemological justification of feminist theory, or relativism, is beyond the scope of this essay and unfortunately beyond my command of the relevant literature.
%A response to this criticism thus has to remain regrettably sketchy.

%\paragraph{The Blinders of Rationality} Its uneasily essentializing, groupist outlook notwithstanding (see further \citealt{Brubaker-2002-aa}), the feminist critique rightfully points to a number of blind spots of deliberation, and, by extension, blind spots of modern rationality.
%To widen the horizon again, Young (\citeyear{Young-1996-aa}:
%130) suggests to relativize rationality, and to allow for rhetoric, storytelling and ``greetings'' by which she means a ``care-taking, deferential, polite acknowledgement of the Otherness of other''.

%Also, she fears, universal rationality sustains hegemonic discourses, and limits our social imagination, as for example the nearly unchallenged postindustrial necessity of individual car mobility (\citealt{Young-2001-aa}:
%687).

%\paragraph{Enlightening the Blind Spots} These blind spots, a modern rationality that takes due regard of the human condition, \emph{can} illuminate, \emph{enlighten}.
%There is nothing quintessentially disregarding of individual experience in modern rationality.
%Correctly understood, rationality points us to the universalized abstractions (for example, the distribution of means of production, productivity, market efficiency) which always condition individual experience in the modern, integrated world.

%Modern rationality does not and should not claim that these constitute exclusive, comprehensively exhaustive or sufficient determinations of individual experience, but they are certainly a \emph{necessary} condition.
%Sometimes, the feminist insistence on individual, ``other'' experiences may actually serve well to perfect a universal rationality, for example, when it questions otherwise hegemonic discourses (`a car for everyone').

%Feminist critics, as I believe all social theoreticians, have to somehow further thinking about the world that enables people, and that enables progress.
%In this context, that means, they have to respond to the certain consequences of modern integration for the individual experience.
%They, and more positivist ventures no less, are obligated to \emph{integrate} the individual experience, its virtues and incomparability, wherever possible.
%But nothing fruitful follows, when the two perspectives are uncompromisingly opposed as mutually exclusive.
%No one is better off, and no one is empowered.

%\paragraph{No Reason Over Power Without Reason} In their discussion of deliberative democracy, feminist critics should pay due regard to its quintessential innovation:
%\emph{reason over power}(\citealt{Young-1996-aa}:
%122).
%This not only describes a historical narrative, but also a functional necessity.
%To overcome ``power'' of plurally organized, but self-interested, and thereby always \emph{particular} agents as justification for aggregated decisions, \emph{some universal} criterion to negate particular claims is required.

%Feminists, it appears, are opposed to this trade-off and believe we can leapfrog to an egalitarian \emph{and} particular utopia, which I think, for once is not only unlikely optimistic, but also, as of yet, inconclusive\footnote{Somewhat surprisingly, \citet{Young-2001-aa} speaks in favor of confrontational political activism of the subaltern elsewhere.
%This stands in an uneasy contrast with her, and the deliberative project's ambition to rid political decision-making of power.
%She argues, forcefully that `to have the subaltern speak \citep{Spivak-1988-aa}, they may have to shout first', before they deliberate.
%This familiar ``overrun'' vs.
%``overcome''dichotomy is not new, well known from the Civil Rights struggle in the U.S..
%The risk is that its main proposition to ``overrun'' old power structures before they can be ``overcome'' may counteract the fundamental, and universal delegitimization of power claims on which deliberation rests.}.

%For now, what remains --- or prevails --- when power is delegitimized, and reason relativized, as the Feminist critique suggests?
%My hunch would be:
%power wins.
%And that, from an enlightened positivist perspective, as well as from emancipative or critical theory viewpoints, cannot be desirable.

%The solution, in \citet{Rawls-1971} operative metaphor, must be to perfect the ``veil of ignorance'' towards power --- not towards individual experience, of necessity --- and to replace it with a human-faced rationality.

%\section{Conclusion:
%\\In Need of New Schools for Democracy}

%This discussion of potential pitfalls of deliberative designs as they are suggested today, and its underlying discourse, must not be misconstrued as an argument against small-level, or any, deliberation.
%My goal was to draw attention to the possibility of inevitable failure of such deliberation, in spite of its desirability because of a frequent incongruence between inputs and outputs, the political and the social world, under newly suggested formats as well as a somewhat questionable optimism about the cognitive competence of deliberating citizens and their equality (!).

%\paragraph{Capacity:
%Keep Going, Go Big} Small-scale deliberations, already, have yielded great results.
%In particular, as \citeauthor{FungWright-2001-aa} (\citeyear{FungWright-2001-aa}:
%29) hope, it has educational qualities ``beyond the proximate scope and effect of participations, these experiments also encourage the development of political wisdom in ordinary citizens by grounding competency upon everyday, situated, experiences rather than simply data mediated through popular press, television or `book learning'.''

%This is a hope that may well be justified, in part.
%Wherever functional differentiation, antecend division of labor and far-flung interdependencies progress to a certain degree, macro abstractions rule the human existence.
%And thus, good deliberators will need their `book learning', too.
%Ordinary citizens (a conspicuous distinction) are affected everyday by things beyond their immediate, grounded experiences, in fact, affected by things they never experience at all.

%It follows a call to reconsider the design of low-level deliberation, of deliberation (exclusively) under devolution in the absence of higher-level decision-making of the same, essentially desirable quality.

%What must follow, are suggestions on how to integrate low-level deliberations at higher levels, and how to bring macro-abstractions to bear on their decision making.
%The recently suggested ``Deliberation Days'' may be one promising avenue to bring higher-level decision-making into the participatory picture, and, by the same token, to reconcile deliberative demands with representative democracy \citep{AckermanFishkin-2002-aa}.

%\paragraph{Competence:
%Keep Going, Careful} Likewise, the skeptical findings about the cognitive competence of deliberators, should not be construed to question the egalitarian or inclusive ambition of the project.
%Rather, they necessitate designs that take due account of this likely fact, in particular, of the unequal cognitive abilities of deliberators.

%As Rosenberg writes:

%\begin{quote}
%``Deliberative fora must not be regarded simply as empty stages that provide a venue for the realization of citizenship;
%nor must the design of these deliberative stages focus simply on the removal of obstructions that may inhibit freedom or give unequal scope for maneuver.
%Instead, deliberation must be understood as a site for the construction and transformation of citizenship.
%In deliberation, citizens are made as well as realized.
%The operative metaphor here is that of a school, but of particular kind.
%The educational goal is not the transmission of specific beliefs and values, although these are by no means irrelevant.
%Rather the central aim must be to foster the requisite cognitive development for a fuller autonomy, a greater communicative competence and a better ability to engage in a collaborative effort to make good and just public policy.''

\subsection[Difference]{Difference} \label{sec:ID-Difference}

\begin{quote}
	\emph{``The boundary is not a spatial fact with sociological consequences, but a sociological fact that forms itself spatially.''} \\
	--- Georg \citet[142]{Simmel1903}
\end{quote}

To this cosmopolitan prescription, people often reply with a positive and normative critique of difference, or --- the dreaded I-word --- identity.

Positive critics of would-be United States of Europe point out that ``empirical conditions'' for democracy and statehood are not given:
there is, supposedly, no european people, no european public sphere and no european party system
\footnote{
	This according to former Hans-Jürgen Papier, former president of the German Constitutional Court at a panel discussion in Berlin on October 17, 2013.
}.
Similarly, \citeauthor{Scharpf1997} more carefully 	speaks of ``a pre-existing sense of community [\ldots], of common history or common destiny, and of common identity'' on which democracy depends, but ``which cannot be created by mere fiat'' \citeyearpar[20]{Scharpf1997}.
Such skepticism about european democracy seems to be founded in the assumption of all hitherto, modern statehood as ``socioculturally homogenous'' (for example, \citealt[93]{BeckGrande-2007-aa} --- a notion that \citeauthor{Scharpf1997}, somewhat illogically, rejects \citeyearpar[20]{Scharpf1997}.
%Historically and conceptually, that is not true:
%(democratic) states made nations at least as much as nations made (democratic) states (\citealt{Gellner-1983-aa}, recently \citealt{Schmitter1999}:
%934).
But even aside the history, methodological nationalism is also epistemologically fallacious.
Again, \citeauthor{Brubaker-2002-aa}'s dictum applies:
if, indeed, we have no European democracy because people feel as citizens of its \gls{MS}, than that is ``what we want to explain, not what we want to explain things \emph{with}'' \citeyearpar[165, emphasis in original]{Brubaker-2002-aa}, or as \citeauthor{Simmel1903} said, a merely spatially formed, but sociological fact.

Normative critics of would-be United States of Europe --- maybe more honestly --- argue for smaller polities to preserve diversity.
Surely diversity of identities and lifestyles is something worth protecting, but this argument perilously confuses what Jonas \cite{Marx2012} has recently identified as \emph{political} and \emph{ontological} identity.
Ontological identity, for \citeauthor{Marx2012}, arises only as actual people get to know each other, their character, and preferences.
Ontological identity, therefore, exclusively resides within small groups or institutions, such as a circle of friends, family or a small firm:
it cannot be scaled up
\footnote{
	\cite{Marx2012}'s ontological identity is similar to \cite{Brubaker-2002-aa}'s definition of groups (as opposed to groupisms):
	they, too, are mutually interacting, as friends and family are, and not merely based on categories, such as ``Greek'' or ``German''.
}.
Political identity, by contrast, can be scaled to arbitrary dimensions, as it arises wherever people form a democratic polity, as their lives become more intertwined by, for example, economic integration.
Maybe inspired by the proto-deliberative \cite{Arendt1958}, \citeauthor{Marx2012} takes pains to remind readers that political identity is \emph{not} merely an assortment of particular, material interest\footnote{
	\citeauthor{Marx2012} points out that etymologically, ``interest'' refers to that between and beyond individuals, and their needs.},
but, by contrast, that one takes on a political identity purely as a choice, if and to the extent that particular, material \emph{needs} are fulfilled.

Both the traditional conflation of ``nation (=) state'' and the difference critique of European integration confuse ontological with political identity.
The nation state assumes \emph{ontological} homogeneity, a dangerous fiction that has gone horribly awry more than once in the 19th and 20th century.
By this rather sorry standard --- political integration through homogenization --- European integration really does look quite worrying.
If not only all Germans must be punctual, Sauerkraut-eating and Goethe-reading, but all Europeans must share the same ``judeo-christian values'', the ``Occident'' really is in trouble.

Pluralist democracy and its supposed home, the nation state, harbor another ideological fiction:
that polities are, or ought to be, merely households, or even families writ-large.
The first-order, material reality of Europe, or any other modern society, is of course truly that of a household, \emph{oikos}, or economy, ruled by interests, or even needs.
But democracy is, and ought to be, more:
it \emph{is} the one, purposeful (not aimless!) process by which societies come up with their second-order answers, and, thus, must ideally be \emph{isolated} from material interest, or need.
Pluralist democracy, however, extends the incentive logic to government:
here, too, as in a household, people have pre-social interests, including material needs, that are simply aggregated into decisions.
Akin to markets, pluralist democracy knows only procedural rules of ``level playing fields'', but allows no substantive standards.
Preferences are a black box, beyond reproach or qualification.
The nation state, likewise --- already etymologically (\emph{natio}, that which has been born) --- presumes (incorrectly) common descent, and therefore suggests that nationals share some common, material interest.
By this standard, too --- politics as interest aggregation, or agglomeration --- further European integration seems doomed, if not dangerous.
If not only in the Bundestag, MPs are supposed to vote their constituents' (or, more malignly, their lobbyists') pocket books, but in the European Parliament, too, MPs vote their countries --- much different --- welfare, the union may fray.

There are more hopeful alternatives to nation state democracy, and therefore, hope for European democracy.

First, there is no reason why further European political integration would require any ontological homogeneity:
just as people drive much the same cars in Portugal as in Sweden, they can be regulated by the same emission's trading and taxed by the same code, without anyone having to give up what they eat, how they dress or to which (or none) god they pray.
In truth, this homogeneity has not existed in the \gls{MS}, except as nationalist ideology or xenophobia-baiting.
A rural Bavarian may not --- other than her passport and other institutional vestiges --- have much more in common with a Hamburger, than with a Parisian, or an Athenian.
They do not even really speak the same language, as is so readily assumed \citep{Kymlicka-2001-aa}:
talking about the economic abstractions of the Euro crisis, a \emph{Financial Times Deutschland}-reading German will have almost as much trouble understanding a \emph{BILD}-reading compatriot as a \emph{Daily Mail}-subscriber from the UK.
Surely, such absence of \emph{logos} is dramatic for democracy, if it is ever to allow \emph{action} \citep{Arendt1958}, but it is not much more of a challenge to establish it between, than within \gls{MS}.

Second, democracy must, and can be more than ``two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner'', as Benjamin Franklin remarked.
The economic abstractions and material view of the mixed economy I have presented here may be misunderstood to suggest that a European intact mixed economy, too, is just another, more efficient way to organize a polity as a large oikos, as \citeauthor{Arendt1958} might have deplored.
That is not so:
european democracy is not instrumental to resolving the \glspl{PD} and other inefficiencies and inequities of currently defunct mixed economies, but the other way around, an intact mixed economy is merely instrumental to restore the freedom from need to \emph{act} democratically as citizens in a newly potent, European polity.

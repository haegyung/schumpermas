%[ ] you won't get there entirely (fung on revolution and deliberation)

%Note somewhere that risk (for example, Beck) may be another topic for deliberation. Here, too, people have systematic misunderstandings (Kahnemann 2012), and it's about power (Paul Slovic) but there are also some truths (Sunstein), it's the same conflict between objective truth and relative truths and autonomy.

\section{A Vision Behind a Tax}
%note: this is from MPP thesis

%This proposal does not ask for a new man, and it should not. It just asks for some new policy. That is where good policy must \emph{start}: in what \emph{can} be legislated in a liberal society.

%This proposal is for \emph{homo economicus}, the civilized version of our selfish demons.

%But good policy does not \emph{end} there. It starts today, but points us to the better angels of our nature.

%Maybe, in time, a tax reform that shrinks the carrots and the sticks of the \emph{invisible hand}, can help give birth to a world with ever less incentives, and ever more intrinsic motivation. We know, we \emph{can} be altruists, like our cousins, the bonobos \citep{Pickett-2009-kx}.

%Maybe, in time, a tax reform that makes it a little harder to tell someones luck from the make of her clothes, can cure the insults to our pride. We know, we \emph{can} be more equal, like our cousins, the bonobos \citep{Pickett-2009-kx}.

%The PCT does not end here, today. This proposal is for \emph{homo reciprocans}, too.

%Maybe, in time, the Progressive Consumption Tax can help build the new habitat for that better, nobler species we can be. So that one day, true to our egalitarian heritage, and our capacity for good, we all are:

%Dr.~Pangloss is really giving optimism a bad name. If anyone is an optimist, it's Candide: ``Let us cultivate our garden.''.
%get Cervantes here: the sickest/craziest person is whoever accepts the world as it is, not as it ought to be.

# A Tale of Three Crises {#crises}

<!-- %if you'd want to hide injustice, you'd best do it in a really complex system, like tax. -->

<!-- % offe:
%write a 2nd order theory on the reform suggestion (such as offe 2009) -->

<!-- i don't even mention the issues of imperfect economic integration here (EU!), though much of them can be read as extensions of the malaise described here -->

<!-- first, you have to show here that tax is a worthwhile issue; it *is* the social contract, and it is currently in bad shape, and it *is* the best way to address a lot of our problems (not spending, not printing money, no nothing) -->

<!-- also, crucially, the point here is *not* how inequality is positively (that is pretty complicated), nor how how the contravening institutions should be calibrated.
The point is that, *no matter* the desired redistribution, the institutions are bad. -->

<!-- this is also, when talking about mixed economy, strictly about institutions which *reconcile* command and market economy (otherwise, somewhat misleadingly, called democracy and capitalism)
it is at this interface that this diss is, and the question is whether the institutions governing this interface are good or bad, whether they can somehow satisfy the demands of *both* an efficient market economy, and a democratically powerful sovereign
the question, emphatically, is not about *where to steer*, so to speak.
but just what kind of steering mechanism we should have
the engineering metaphor doesn't fully work of course, because, as it turns out, it's not a well-defined engineering problem that you can outsource to experts (maybe not even in engineering, who knows)
there are *already* deep, last-reason kind of question *in* the design questions for the steering mechanism, so to speak
that is what this is about
some people criticise this as "market-compatible democracy", but that's misleading.
neither mechanism is somehow inherently superior, or more legitimate.
or at least there is no reason to assume this here. -->

<!-- it's easy to see how accounts of material inequality (or lack thereof) become marred in ontological and axiological fights, and burrow down to last reasons -- though *these* are emphatically *not* the last reasons that are of interest here.
to name just a few, whether you include household size, or real wages, or improvements in products, these all easily and fundamentally change the picture and any trends -->

<!-- also, this kinda feels like the "good old days", as if things were much better earlier.
that's not really the point
this is not primarily, an account of how things have gotten worse *empirically*: in part, that becomes pretty hard, because so many other things change (multicollinearity)
there may not be much to be gained here, or, in any case, that's not what I offer here.
Instead, across tax, welfare state and democracy, I point out *a priori* inconsistencies in the ideal-typical versions of these institutions, as they were instituted in the past.
This need not imply that the past was actually all that great.
It's really just a pragmatic way of going about this: one might also call this a tale of three not-quite-great systems, but that just doesn't have the same ring to it.
nothing wrong with urgency
but be careful here, I don't actually have a posteriori (empirical) account.
more crucially, this being a priori stuff, it also *needs* no such account; pointing to the contradictions suffices.
this is just politicisation, in a way.
WHY this chapter?
because it points to the importance, and takes the first step to the last reasons, to the deep disagreements undergirding this all.
politicisation is, broadly speaking, necessary for any deliberation.
you need some kind of a question.
if this were in fact all completely "normal", and just the way things are, then there's no need.
so going back to the ideal-typical formulation of these institutions, no matter how much they were ever attained in the real world, is an exercise in policisiation.
The empirical record, is only used to cursorily *illustrate* these claims. -->

<!-- 
why so careful, one might ask?
because a) it's really unclear. b) economize on moral disagreement
and really, we *should* agree that the sovereign should have institutions available to do this, as he/she pleases, if that is in fact possible (that is to be decided! make a footnote to the epilogue here!)
this is, fundamentally, neutral and open-ended: it is possible that the resulting, better institutions will strictly limit the amount of redistribution (however loosely defined!) that is possible.
or it could give the sovereign a much more powerful lever to redistribute as she sees fit.
or lastly, it could be completely impossible.

<!-- %The result of the two crises is an economy with runaway inequities, foregone productive capacity and a suboptimal net savings rate, in the face of greater challenges ahead (for example, aging, global warming).

## Taxation and Welfare

Why does taxation matter for human welfare?

As @Schumpeter knew, "in the modern world, taxation *is* the social contract" [@Martin2009a, 1, emphasis in original], even though social scientists have since paid little attention to it [@Tilly2009, K191].
Tax matters especially for current OECD-style welfare regimes, in which markets and states must co-exist [@Stiglitz2011].
In such a mixed economy, government must be able to draft some privately-owned resources to serve its --- ideally democratic --- *command*, without unduly altering the prices of --- ideally competitive --- *exchanges* [@Ardant1975, 165f].
<!-- TODO ref chapter on mixed econ here -->
Much of modern social integration occurs in the balance of these two contrasting logics to produce and allocate resources, "enmesh[ing] us in the web of generalized reciprocity that constitutes modern society" [@Martin2009a, 3].
State plans make the conditions *for*, and set limits *to* *individual* action, as when government builds roads or collects sewage fees.
Conversely, market exchanges produce much of the "fungible resources" used for *collective* choice, as when government pays road builders or procures sewage pipes [@Martin2009a, 4].

Of all conceivable institutions to govern the interface of states and markets, taxation --- not price controls, not expropriation, not debt, not printing money, not tariffs --- is the most equitable, efficient and sustainable [@MusgThet1959; @Stiglitz2011].
<!-- TODO ref tax-matters chapter -->
Welfare states, with their penchant for market interventions for equity, efficiency *and* sustainability, especially, rely on good taxes.

<!-- %bad überleitung, the instead doesnt work -->
Still, taxation everywhere in the OECD is in crisis.
As alternative sources of economic relief --- monetary expansion and sovereign debt --- are maxed out, structural misalignments persist, and previously forestalling (asset) bubbles have burst into their days of reckoning, public revenues appear to be strictly limited by the longtime coming contradictions of current tax regimes [@Streeck2013].
<!-- %not sure about this soure, must read it -->
The popular mixture of (progressive) income, (proportional) consumption and (regressive) payroll taxes appears to offer only harshly unattractive tradeoffs between equity and efficiency [@McCafferyHines2010], as bases have shrunk and schedules flattened [@Ganghof2006].
At the same time --- possibly partly as a result --- inequalities of incomes and wealth have widened [@Butterwegge; @Wagner2007; @Grabka2007].[^no_wealth_distro]
<!-- TODO mention here that inequality findings are contentious -->

[^no_wealth_distro]: Data on the distribution of wealth is conspicuously hard to come by [@Crouch2004, 158] or ordinally summarized in deciles, rendering much of the inequality invisible.

If governments cannot raise the resources necessary to meet democratic demands without incurring prohibitive costs, the social contract is fraying [@Crouch2004].
<!-- %so so shource -->
Whichever way governments now turn, absent better tax, they will violate the post-war capitalist compact of stable, widely shared growth [@Pierson2002; @StreeckMertens2010].
<!-- %so-so source -->
<!-- TODO ref 3-crisis chapter -->

<!-- ## Ganghof 2007

notes two things:
income taxation isn't enough, it needs to be on capital, too
income taxation nesd to be progressive
provides a cool argument 1063 how (institutional) veto playing may favor, rather than weaken the forces of retrenchmecn because of the wide-reaching legal changes that would be required to avoid retrechnment
Kato 2003 as cited in ibid 1064: yes, a revenue shift to regressive taxes makes it politically easier to maintain a large public sector (51) but that is a bad idea, it's not the idea of a welfare state
1075 says that there are few major overhauls of tax systems because they are associated with significant transaction costs and political risks, so centrist and pragmatic policy makers will avoid that.


## Ganghof 2004

scharpf in foreword 12 cites the negative employment effects of high social contributions, also inequitable because they're strictly proportional
also in scharpf foreword 13: MwST does 2 bad things: it depresses the price-elastic demand for low-qualification service industry jobs (which is very bad) and it raises the costs of living for everyone.
Scharpf is right when he says there is much to explain about the chaos of german tax. In fact, there is MUCH more to be explained if you look at a perfect counterfactual.
19 CIT and PIT highest marginal rates are same in Germany since 1977 (and for a  good reason)
25 make this key point: when Ganghof suggests a dual income tax for germany, fundamental equity (OR efficiency) concerns are long past. 25. He cites two "pragmatic reasons" 1) it will be easier to find a cap income tax rate that is low enough to include as many as possible kinds of cap income. 2) labor incomes can still be taxed progressively.
wow, where's the innovation?

## Genschel 2004

the sceptics and the revisionists have it wrong: because they lack the right counterfactual 616
the welfare state is indeed, and rightly so, expected to do 2 things as Genschel 617 writes (this is part of the two criterion)
to systematically control economic developments at the macro-level (macro-economic control), and
to guarantee, unconditionally, adequate living standards at the micro-level (redistributive social policy)

note that really depreciation isn't all that difficult: we do that for firms, too and we do it fairly roughly. We can do that for households, too. Also: if people sell their stuff at some point, we may even allow them to correct for the depreciation up or downwards. -->


<!-- %Developed welfare states are faced with a twin crisis of fiscal configuration that is mutually reinforcing:
%one of structural unemployment, and one of structural underfunding.

%Structural unemployment is caused by effective price floors for labor, at or below the socially acceptable minimum income in a society, but above the labor productivities of a segment of the working population.

%Structural underfunding is caused by a state that is increasingly unable to raise sufficient revenues necessary for the provision of public and common goods, as well as to finance its redistributive needs.
%The result of the two crises is an economy with forgone productive capacity and suboptimal, collective net investments in the face of greater challenges.

%\subsection{Boundary Conditions}
%Three boundary conditions exacerbate the situation.

%\paragraph{Aging} One is the aging (and later, shrinking) of the population of most developed welfare states (\marginpar{\textsf{reference and expand on second demographic transformation literature here, include empirical findings})}.
%Below replacement level ($\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total-fertility-rate}{tfr}<2.1$) fertility rates curtail future growth.
%Worsening dependency ratios require ever more resources to be consumed.
%
%Aging is, in effect, a loan on future generations, taken out already:
%even if fertility rates would return to above replacement level today, demographic dynamics would take decades to recover.
%Interest and principal on this loan are usually not included in calculations of net private saving or public investment \marginpar{\textsf{(reference)}}, but the pinch is starting to be felt \marginpar{\textsf{(reference)}}.
%
%\paragraph{Changing Factor Returns} Under international trade and capital mobility, not only the allocation of factors --- in idealized form, a Ricardian division of labor --- but also the factor \emph{returns} change.
%According to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, the relatively abundant factor in an open economy becomes more expensive vis-\`a-vis a relatively scarce, cheaper factor (as cited in\cite{KrugmanObstfeld-2007-aa}) \marginpar{\textsf{(need to dig deeper into this, read more, elaborate, provide empirical support)}}.
%
%This effect is commonly known as a the de-industrialization of the west, where, under trade and/or capital mobility, the OECD-world specializes on (human) capital-intensive production, and labor-intensive production is rendered largely obsolete.
%Where it persists --- for example in the service sector --- it creates only low returns, when compared to autarky.
%
%\paragraph{Imperfectly Governed International Political Economy} The second boundary condition is a liberalized, but only imperfectly governed international political economy.
%Factors of production, chiefly capital, are highly mobile and have through competitive pressure curtailed, if not diminished, the ability of states to redirect resources through taxation \marginpar{\textsf{(cite preliminary references here, reformulate as hypothesis)}}.
%No international regime for effective cooperation in the field of tax policy has arisen yet, to supersede or replace now impaired national polities.
%
%\subsection{Deficient Policy Responses}
%Under the given boundary conditions, developed welfare states have chosen suboptimal policies that brought about the twin crisis of structural unemployment and structural underfunding.
%Policy responses have been likewise deficient.
%
%\subsubsection{Structural Unemployment}
%\paragraph{Low Productivity $+$ Price Floors $=$ Structural Unemployment} States have created and exacerbated structural unemployment by raising effective price floors for labor, by means of statutory minimum wages or decommodifying social transfers.
%Means-tested welfare reform and benefit cuts in the last three decades notwithstanding, states have failed to harness completely the low-productivity strata of the labor force, at socially acceptable incomes \marginpar{\textsf{(reference)}}.
%
%Incomes and employment of low-productivity workers often appear to be in a zero-sum relationship \marginpar{\textsf{(elaborate, and reference)}}.
%
%\paragraph{Underinvestment in Education}In a similar (and related) case of loaning resources from the future as in the case of below-replacement fertility, many family policy regimes and education systems fail to equip new generations with the necessary skills to be sufficiently productive to maintain, let alone enhance living standards \marginpar{\textsf{(empirical reference)}}.
%The underinvestment in education has to be understood against the backdrop of the above-mentioned changing factor returns, where only (human) capital-intensive production yields socially acceptable incomes.
%
%\paragraph{A Grim Outlook}Future labor markets await ever smaller cohorts with a large share of inadequately qualified workers, destined to become transfer recipients and, under current policies, unemployed.
%Destined to be decommodified --- rendered useless, in fact.
%
%\subsubsection{Structural Underfunding}
%
%\paragraph{Increasing Expenditure $+$ Tax Competition $=$ Structural Underfunding} Structural underfunding came about as the net result of increasing expenditure requirements and downward pressures for taxes on increasingly mobile factors of production, chiefly capital.
%
%\paragraph{A Regressive Shift Towards Immobile Bases} Taxation, as a result, has shifted to immobile bases, towards consumption and labor.
%Consumption taxes are implemented as indirect, prepaid, flat, value-added taxes.
%They are inherently regressive as earners of lower incomes spend relatively more of their available resources, and save little or nothing.
%Earners of high incomes, particularly from capital gains, also pay taxes on their eventual consumption, but consume less overall, and can earn untaxed interests from delayed consumption.
%
%Particularly in continental, Bismarck-type welfare states such as Germany, a great share of the increasing de-facto tax burden of insuring health, accident, old age, and unemployment burdens immobile bases of low- and medium-income labor as social contributions, or effective wage taxes \marginpar{\textsf{(references, numbers)}}.
%Like indirect taxes, they are regressive (above a certain threshold) over all earners, even when progressive on labor incomes.
%In Germany, they are straightforwardly regressive by means of capping. -->

<!-- %\paragraph{The Sad Tale of Progressive Income Taxation} Lastly remain the personal and corporate income tax.
%Here, the base has stayed the same, if not broadened through the filling of tax gaps \citep{Genschel2009}.
%Previously sharply progressive rates have been cut to generally no higher than 40\% on average (not at the margin) \marginpar{\textsf{(insert more citations, graphs, empirical evidence here)}}.
%
%\subparagraph{Loophole:
%Foreign Corporate Income Tax} International capital mobility is operative in depressing the personal income tax by providing possibilities for evading domestic corporate taxes abroad.
%
%When income taxes are progressive, international capital mobility provides a way out.
%High earners can invest in companies abroad, the earnings of which will not be taxed at domestic rates.
%Eventual capital inflows (assuming perfect tax administration) will be taxed, but avoiding the taxation of interest and sharp progression through income smoothing.
%
%\paragraph{Dysfunctions of Progressive Income Taxation} Progressive income taxation is also problematic because it creates disincentives for saving by taxing it twice, once when it is initially earned, and then again, when it generates an interest.
%More generally, progressive income taxation could be criticized to reduce the rewards for hard work and risk-taking investment - which is to some extent true for all progressive schedules.
%
%\subparagraph{The Ugly:
%Corporate Income Tax} The necessary antecedent of a progressive income tax, a \emph{corporate} income tax, creates further dysfunctional dynamics.
%It is prone to international tax competition of its highly mobile base, as argued in the above.
%
%Moreover, corporate income taxation necessarily applies one uniform rate over the entire firm (if not economy), thereby counteracting the individual different and progressive rate of the income tax.
%
%The lifesavings of a worker, invested in a company through her life insurance, are taxed at exactly the same rate as the share of a stock-market tycoon.
%
%Most troublesome, a corporate income tax is fundamentally indeterminate with regard to its base:
%whether, and to which degree its incidence falls on labor (the respective employees) or capital (the respective owners), is a matter of econometric uncertainty and likely depends on a host of firm- and market-specific factors, including the price elasticities of capital and labor \citep{Graetz2009}.
%
%To sum up, a progressive income tax with its antecedent, a (progressive) corporate income tax, \begin{enumerate} \item{undermines the progressive logic of taxation,} \item{arbitrarily burdens capital or labor, and} \item{taxes saving twice,} \end{enumerate} all of which can contribute to the structural underfunding of the state.
%
%Counteracting progression hurts revenues by offering possibilities for tax evasion.
%An arbitrary burdening of capital or labor can contribute to a haphazard macro-economic disequilibrium between the two factors of production, wherein one is underemployed (credit crunch or unemployment, respectively), that will be further elaborated in the below.
%Taxing saving twice reduces incentives to accumulate capital, which is conducive to growth and thereby erodes the future basis of taxation.
%
%\subsubsection{Mututally Reinforcing Twin Crisis}
%
%To make matters worse, the two crises of structural unemployment and structural underfunding mutually reinforce each other.
%
%\paragraph{Regressive, Indirect Taxation Creates Unemployment} The move towards the less mobile tax bases of consumption, low- and medium labor income makes matters worse on the low- and medium productivity labor market.
%
%\subparagraph{Higher Price Floors} A high VAT, regressive that it is, burdens low-income earners more and directly raises the necessary socially acceptable minimum income by that percentage.
%The same applies to capped, wage tax-style social contributions which add an extra \marginpar{\textsf{(include figures, references here)}} wedge between labor productivities and effective price floors.
%
%More generally, the same applies to low- and medium-income taxation, where, when burdened proportionately (or \emph{out} of proportion, really) with other natural persons and their capital, incentives to work in the presence of effective price floors disappear.
%
%\subparagraph{Procyclical Labor Costs} A further corollary of pseudo-independent but in fact quasi-fiscal administration of social contributions is a highly procyclical dynamic:
%when collective labor demand falls during a macroeconomic slump, costs of labor will rise, further reducing the demand for labor.
%
%\paragraph{Underinvestment Makes Permanent Structural Unemployment}
%Measured by its success to guarantee productive work for everyone at socially acceptable pay, the present revenue configuration can indeed be diagnosed to be fundamentally underfunding the welfare state.
%
%Less``political'' and more clearly, the underfunded state cannot afford the titanic transformations, colossal investments and massive redistribution (!) needed in education to equip the future workforce with the necessary skills to maintain and enhance our gross domestic production.
%To attain a future where every healthy adult is productive enough to earn a socially acceptable income without transfers or "idleness below the price floor" for now requires a gigantic upfront investment, a polity potent enough to redirect resources at collective, democratic will.
%
%\subparagraph{Approximating an Absolute, Not Moving Socially Acceptable Minimum} Critics will rightfully point out, that at any level and non-uniform distribution of skills, productivities and GDP, there will be people below the average.
%It is of course circularly true, that it will be impossible to assume said goal if we assume``socially acceptable minimum'' to be anything close to a moving average.
%I find this critique misleading on two counts.
%
%First of all, it assumes that in fact, what we find acceptable, or happiness, is a relative, not an absolute concept.
%There are good normative, conceptual \marginpar{\textsf{(cite literature on diminishing returns to wealth)}} and empirical \marginpar{\textsf{(cite happiness research, in particular \cite{Veenhoven-2005-ab})}} that suggest that this is, in fact, not the case.
%
%Being able to pay for your kids' schooltrip rather than not may just make the difference, somewhat independent of whether that other person just bought her third vacation home.
%
%Also, the ``moving average dilemma'' is impossible to achieve in the absolute --- but we can still be closer, or farther away from it.
%What the above goal then means is to compress the distribution around that moving average, not to flatten it out entirely.
%In education, that goal of a flattened income distribution is achieved not through zero-sum style, straightforward but blunt redistribution, but through collectively and individually beneficial investments into human capital.
%
%\subsection{A Vicious Cycle of Impotence}
%From the present fiscal configuration emerges a vicious cycle of the twin crises of structural unemployment and structural underfunding.
%A vicious cycle, in which an ever eroding ability to tax, collectively invest, and redistribute continues to impair the state \marginpar{\textsf{(Cite \cite{Zurn-2000-aa}} and others on input/output incongruency here)}.
%A vicious cycle which creates a hollowed out, impotent polity which is no longer able to decisively redirect its resources with a view to long-term social optima.
%
%A political economy emerges, which increasingly --- if unsustainably --- redistributes the collectively available fruits of labor, skill and this planets resources to a well-qualified, mobile and capital-owning elite.
%A political economy which unleashes a new dynamic of economic bifurcation, thought to be overcome after Manchester capitalism \marginpar{\textsf{(reference \cite{Taleb2007}} and talk about scale-free dynamics of capital accumulation here)}.
%This time around, workers may not be left in quite a dire state --- we may just allow them sufficiently large transfers for them not to starve or create unrest.
% Alternatively, they may be brought back into work under dire conditions, rather than transfers.
%This latter lowering of socially acceptable incomes and working conditions appears to be the trend under recent policies curbing benefit levels.
%
%In any case, a meaningful participation in the society and wider partaking in its fruits may be limited to only a subset of people. -->

### Crisis of Equality

<!-- (not sure about this one) -->

<!-- %look into the short paper by Frank again.
%\cite{Frank1996} argues that top salaries have grown because of 1) technological forces that greatly amplify small increments in performance (non-linear returns to scale?) and 2) increased competition for services of top performers (not sure what this is).
%In winner-take all markets you pay by relative, not absolute performance.

%note the ``expenditure cascade'' Frank argument. -->

Again, not an empirical claim per se, but it seems worth nothing that as per a priori logic, there may be runaway dynamics of inequality, for which we might have no *possible* counteracting tax institution.
pperhaps, we don't actually want to use that institution, or only to a limited amount, because its costs are too high, or the boons of overall growth are too great, but whatever, it'd be nice to have it available to the sovereign.

A complete empirical test of the governing dynamics of inequality is beyond the scope of this thesis.
[^5]
Here are some tentative statistics which support the thesis of self-reinforcing inequality.

According to the US Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) the range between the lowest and highest sextile (!) of median before-tax family income has risen from \$145,000 in 1989 to \$170,000 in 2004 [@Bucks2006].
During the same period, the mean gap between the outer sextiles has increased from roughly \$245,000 to \$295,000 (*ibid.*).
The mean income gap for extreme quartiles of education of head of household has increased from \$80,000 \$115,000 (*ibid.*).
While the *median* net worth is reported to to be roughly \$90,000 in 2004, the respective *mean* is around \$450,000.
The median (mean) range between the outer quintiles (!) of net worth has increased from \$1,000,000 (around \$1,800,000) in 1989 to above \$1,400,000 (\$3,000,000) in 2004.
Interestingly, even the median (mean) gap between the topmost quintiles has increased from \$600,000 (\$1,500,000) to \$900,000 (above \$2,500,00).
[^6]

In Germany, a similar trend is discernible.
From 1998 to 2006, the Gini coefficients
[^7]
in real gross wages (not incomes!)
[^8]
continuously rose from 0.407 to 0.453 [@Bundesregierung2006 14].
Interestingly, even the range between the topmost deciles in share of all gross wages rose from 9.8 to 10.6 [@Grabka2007a 64].
For all gross (net) incomes the Gini coefficient rose (roughly continuously) from 0.465 (0.261) to 0.520 (0.316) [-@Grabka2007a 82].
The Gini of wealth distribution rose continuously from 0.745 in 2002 to 0.795 in 2007 [-@Grabka2007a 138].

In sum, inequality seems to be increasing over time, in labor and capital income, and in wealth.
Distributions of income and wealth are, in fact, decidedly non-normal, but starkly positively skewed as evidenced by the ever diverging medians and means.
These tentative statistics then support the central tenet of self-reinforcing governing dynamics of inequality.

[^2]: I assume here that market wages are low *only* because of low productivities, in keeping with condition itm:infinite-buyers-sellers ().
    If, by contrast, employers have great bargaining power over non-unionized workers (as appears to be the case in much of the service sector) they may receive low wages even when their labor productivities are adequate.
    Such Manchester-capitalism styled exploitation should be met with regulatory, not fiscal interventions:
    otherwise, government may end up transferring to exploitative firms.

    It does not matter *why* labor productivity of some groups of workers is in *relative* decline.
    Candidate culprits include international trade and finance (for example, discredited @Stolper1941) as well as skill-based technological progress [@Card2001].
    Whatever the reason for low relative labor productivities, an efficient fiscal configuration should help factor markets clear.

[^5]: Also, comprehensive data about income and wealth distributions are conspicuously hard to come by.
    Most government or international organizations report only various *risk of poverty indicators* or, at best, decile ranges or ratios.
    Gini coefficients, histograms or more comprehensive measures of income dispersion are not readily available, particular for wealth.
    The statistics that are provided oddly focus on poverty --- not on inequality --- and use *ordinal* measures of dispersion (decile ranges), which, by definition, conceal outliers in skewed distributions.
    The few, notable examples of more comprehensive datasets include the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) [@Wagner2007; @Grabka2007].

[^6]: Comparing two years, of course, does not make a trend.
    For most indicators of inequality in the triennial SCF, there is a continuous upward trend beginning in the latter half of the 1990s, with a noticeable dip in inequality in the early 1990s [@Bucks2006].

[^7]: The Gini coeffecient is a comprehensive measure of inequality in cardinal distributions.
    It measures the divergence of actual distributions from uniform ("egalitarian") distributions.
    Zero is perfect equality, one is perfect inequality.

[^8]: Labor incomes are likely to display relatively *less* inequality than total incomes, or wealth.
    Labor incomes are (page ).

    It emerges the picture of a world, where the link between initial states and outcomes is highly non-linear.
    Marginal increases in, say, education, may lead to very large income effects --- or none at all.
    A world, where not everyone can be the meritocratic master of her own luck.
    A little more effort *may* get you that big year-end bonus, or a lot of effort may get you no reward at all.
    A world, where economic and social outcomes do not follow a bell-shaped distribution, with most people around mean incomes and status, and very few at the extremes.
    This is a world, where both those left and right of the mean will get ever farther away from it.

    The governing dynamics of inequality are that of the Matthew Principle, popularized by Robert K. [@Merton1988; @Jackson1968].
    Left to its own devices, the (post?)industrial economy is a "winner-take-all ecology" [@Taleb2007], accurately described in the words of scripture cited above.


### Efficiency and Equity

Equity and efficiency are not a zero-sum trade-off.
Sometimes, when the cake is sliced up more equitably, it may grow.
Formulations of such positive-sum relationship between the two vary, and only some examples can be given here.

<!-- efficiency vs equity
Equity and efficiency, at the extremes, are not as conceptually orthogonal as conveniently assumed:
Excessive inefficiency is, in fact, likely to be inequitable, too, as government failure to provide public goods and pool risks has a social gradient.
Poorer individuals will be hit harder, because public goods and lemons markets are not, in truth, dichotomous and uniform phenomena.
In the real world, some public goods (for example, policing) have close, if costly private good substitutes (for example, gated community.
Similarly, some risks will be more symmetrically observable (for example, buyers of private health insurance in Germany tend to be better and better-known risks).
Alternatively, rich people may have enough assets to forego risk pooling alltogether (for example, excessive co-payments).
In short, rich people can often buy their way out of otherwise underfunded or failing public institutions, creating yet greater inequities [@Barry2002]. -->
<!-- %Moreover, inequality and common/public goods and risk pooling are not as distinct concepts as presented in the above table, when taken to the (reasonable) extreme and adding a dynamic dimension.
%
%Inequality is, in the above assumed to be a policy challenge in its own right, that calls for \emph{redistribution}.
%Alternatively, from a more dynamic perspective, gross, self-reinforcing inequities could also be framed as public or common good problems, where excessive inequality exerts a negative externality of non-opportunity on the poorgTaking things further into the future, presently existing inequality could be assumed to exert a negative externality on the future, forgoing otherwise more broadly-based growth.
%
%Conversely, excessive underprovision of common/public goods or a lack of effective risk-pooling easily hits the poor hardest, who have few other resources to buy or substitute the lacking goods.
%
%Policy makers should, however, be careful not to introduce duplicate redistributive mechanisms in other state activities, such as Pigouvian taxes or fees, which are not geared towards everyone, but a certain type of behavior or service consumed.
%
%A further requirement of ``regulatory neatness'' and corrolarly of this thinking is that redistributive and revenue-generation taxes should in principal be levied on natural persons exclusively.
%Only between natural persons is redistribution meaningful, even ignoring the above-mentioned problems of incidence and uniform progression discussed in the above. -->

for a large and highly qualified workforce, and concerns of social immobility in (post)industrial economies (for example, Lisbon Strategy, EU 2020).
For a knowledge economy, you need lots of qualified and motivated people, not just a few stars.
### Structural Unemployment {#sec:StructuralUnemployment} -->
<!-- TODO I think this needs another quote on incomplete contracts or sth -->

Extreme inequality in post-tax market outcomes may also conflict with the efficiency goal of full factor employment.
Most (post)industrial societies have legislated socially accepted minimal incomes.
This legislation takes the form of statutory minimum wages or unemployment benefits.
Either way, an effective or de-facto price floor for wages is established.
[^1]

[^1]: Income subsidies or negative income taxes may not lead to such dysfunctional price floors ([c.f.](http://maxheld.de/2010/04/19/sharing-the-burden/) @Held2010).

People with productivities *below* this price floor will not find employment, leading to a DWL of structural unemployment.
[^2]

Crucially, the level of minimal incomes depends on the broader configuration of tax incidence, indirect taxes in particular.
When taxes are relatively flat and fall on labor or consumption, the real costs of living for low-income earners rise.
This *tax wedge* can take the form of (flat or proportional, payroll-style) social contributions, VAT or a relatively flat or proportional personal income tax:
either way, *more* money has to be made on the market for the same living standard (in Purchasing Power Parities, PPP).

The implications for tax design are twofold:

#### Structural Unemployment as Endogenous.

The only genuine fix to structural unemployment is of course more education to lift people, or at least their children, out of their low standards of productivity.
Better education, to be sure, will require fresh ideas --- but also lots of public resources.
Well-funded public education, in turn, is endogenous to a fiscal configuration.

#### Structural Unemployment as Exogenous.

Even from a static perspective, assuming low-productivity workers to be exogenous, some measure of tax relief for would-be working poor may enhance welfare.
An efficient tax system should reduce the burden on low-productivity earners, to keep their post-tax socially acceptable minimum wages as low as possible.

[\[des:low-price-floor\]]{#des:low-price-floor label="des:low-price-floor"}
A desirable tax has a minimal incidence on low-productivity earners to lower their cost of living.


## Bad Tax

> *"Things in tax are bad today."*\
> --- Edward J. @McCaffery2005 [893]

The Forerunner: Indirect, Proportional Taxes: VAT & Payroll {#sec:ScoreVAT}

Indirect, proportional taxes are the forerunners in tax choice today.
For the last two to three decades, they have assumed an ever greater share of GDP, compared to other taxes (for Germany and the UK, see [@Kemmerling2009 11].

VAT and Payroll, for all their differences, share key characteristics:
they are indirect, they are proportional and they fall on relatively immobile bases.

#### Neutrality.

The key merit of indirect, proportional taxation is its neutrality to relative prices in the economy:
deadweight losses are indeed , as per desideratum [\[des:minimal-DWL\]](#des:minimal-DWL){reference-type="ref" reference="des:minimal-DWL"}.

##### Everyone Has to Consume.

For the VAT, the neutrality case is clear-cut.
Ultimately, people can only spend the savings and (capital, labor) income they have on goods on the market.
If buying of *all* goods is proportionally taxed, people have no way to avoid the tax.
They *cannot* react to a price signal that is *universally* increased:
their (page ) is minimal.
The same holds for sellers:
they have to sell to someone.
When every potential buyer has to bear the same tax, sellers have no way to react.
Their (p. ) is minimal, too.
The VAT falls on a as per desideratum [\[des:tax-inelastic\]](#des:tax-inelastic){reference-type="ref" reference="des:tax-inelastic"}.

##### Everyone Has to Work ...

A proportional payroll tax is neutral when one accepts an exclusive, (page ).
When capital rents are only *compensation* for risky, deferred consumption all savings and capital rents are ultimately labor incomes.
Under the , someone living off her savings is someone living off her past work.
In short, to consume and to live at all, everybody has to work, for someone, sometime.
If you have to work for someone, and every potential employment is subject to the same, proportional tax, you cannot react to the tax.
Again, the of labor supply (page ) is minimal.
The same holds for employers:
they have to employ someone.
If every potential employer is subjected to the same, proportional tax, their of labor demand (page ) is minimal, too.
[^7]

##### ...Except the Rich.

Under a (page ), a proportional tax is not neutral.
When capital rents are a genuine increment to wealth, there is an alternative to work:
you can either work, or live off your interest.
In formal terms, rich people can substitute their labor income with capital income.
As the availability of substitutes increases price elasticity, the labor supply by rich people is no longer price inelastic.
Absent the payroll tax, they might have elected to work more than they will if their labor income is taxed.

##### Ideally, A Ordoliberally Hygienic Tax.

A neutral tax, by definition, has no fee or pigouvian component.
A VAT or payroll tax with a proportional, uniform rate is as per desideratum [\[des:ordoliberal-hygiene\]](#des:ordoliberal-hygiene){reference-type="ref" reference="des:ordoliberal-hygiene"}.

#### Redistribution $=$ General Revenue?

To the extent that proportional taxation is accepted as an equity norm (!), a VAT or payroll that goes into general government revenue is a proper instrument both to , as a desirable tax should as per desideratum [\[des:redistribution-and-revenue-are-one\]](#des:redistribution-and-revenue-are-one){reference-type="ref" reference="des:redistribution-and-revenue-are-one"}.

In Germany and many other countries, *capped* payroll taxes are used to raise social insurance contributions.
Here, redistribution and revenue generation undesirably interact.

First, social insurance contributions are proper taxes:
they serve to pool risks and they redistribute between old and young, healthy and sick.
Second, these services are actually provided universally and unconditionally:
as a last resort, the (German) welfare state pays even for those who have *not* contributed.
The welfare state polity, has in other words, already adopted an allocative norm.

Raising revenue for these very services on a *regressive* schedule (capped) on only some incomes (employed labor) embodies another, very specific allocation, for which no normative justification is readily available.
In Germany, only employed people pay for the health insurance of all other employed people.
Exactly *why*, at minimum, self-employed people do not also contribute to this risk pool is unexplained, but allocatively consequential.

#### Fairness.

At best, a VAT or payroll tax can be regarded as a proportional taxation on as per desideratum [\[des:personal-taxation\]](#des:personal-taxation){reference-type="ref" reference="des:personal-taxation"}.
[^8]
It cannot accommodate progression, let alone an arbitrarily steep schedule.

##### Payroll: Regressive.

An (ideal) payroll tax is proportional only under an (page ).
When capital rents are regarded as proper income (, page ), a payroll tax falls only on one of two types of incomes.
A payroll tax is clearly not , as mandated by desideratum [\[des:structural-agnosticism\]](#des:structural-agnosticism){reference-type="ref" reference="des:structural-agnosticism"}.

##### VAT: Proportional.

No matter the savings norm, a VAT is straightforwardly proportional, because *all* income is ultimately consumed and tax liable to generate utility.

##### Different Rates Are Not An Option.

One common alteration to make the VAT fairer is to adopt different rates for different types of products.
Goods that cover basic needs (food) often enjoy a lower VAT rate.
In a complex economy and modern society, it is impossible to easily determine which goods satisfy basic needs and which do not.
Is a meat a basic need?
Is a filet mignon?
Is a filet mignon every day?
<!-- %more generally, this violates the norm of neutrality, it will affect less people who buy 10 sedans than people who buy 1 luxury car.
%This is about as non-agnostic as it gets. -->

When the state *does* establish different VAT rates, it risks becoming a micro-manager of fairness and will create arbitrary incentives for cross-substitution.

#### The Problems of Proportional Taxation.

Aside from not being progressive, a proportional tax raises a number of problems (page ).

##### Diminishing Utility and Positional Consumption.

As proportional taxes, VAT and payroll cannot consider of wealth, income or consumption.
Whether you are struggling to pay for the first class trip of your child or whether you are thinking about signing up your child for the third summer school, the taxman will treat these two transactions equally, irrespective of the clearly differential impact on the subjective well-being --- not to mention opportunity --- of parents and child in these two families.

Similarly, a proportional VAT on consumption can also not curb ().
Whether you are buying a high-priced Mercedes sedan because you enjoy a luxury car during your frequent trips on the German autobahn, or whether you are buying it merely because you do not want the smaller car than your neighbor, the taxman will treat these two transactions equally, with no regard to a potentially wasteful, positional component of consumption.

##### Proportional Taxation Raises the Effective Price Floor of Labor.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:PropTaxDWL\]]{#sec:PropTaxDWL label="sec:PropTaxDWL"}
Most problematically, any proportional taxation will make it relatively more expensive for low-income earners to make ends meet.
In welfare states with legislated or effective minimal standards of living, such an increase in the real costs of living will push more people into structural unemployment.
When every trip to the grocery store gets more expensive, more low-skilled people will be unable to afford a socially acceptable minimal standard of living from their equilibrium incomes.
Conversely, the (very price-elastic) demand for such low-qualification service jobs drops dramatically, as struggling workers try to extract higher wages (Scharpf in foreword to @Ganghof2004 [12ff]).
An equivalent dynamic holds for proportional payroll taxes.

Proportional taxation raises the in violation of desideratum [\[des:low-price-floor\]](#des:low-price-floor){reference-type="ref" reference="des:low-price-floor"}.
Present some income-replacing transfer scheme, as is nearly universally the case in developed welfare states, supply for low-productivity work becomes very elastic:
you can either work for *less* net purchasing power, or receive *same* or a little more from the state for not working at all.
Proportional VAT or payroll taxation then creates a substantial of structural unemployment, disallowed in desideratum [\[des:minimal-DWL\]](#des:minimal-DWL){reference-type="ref" reference="des:minimal-DWL"}.
[^9]

##### Limited Stabilization.

Proportional taxation, by definition cannot serve as an automatic stabilizer.
When the schedule is linear, it does not matter how lumpy your consumption is.
A VAT or ideal payroll will do nothing to prevent you from buying nothing during a bust, and too much during a boom.

A proportional VAT could, theoretically serve as an discretionary stabilizer if government were to lower the VAT rate during the downturn.
People would have an incentive to buy at lower taxes during the downturn, rather than later at higher rates.

Unemployment insurance works as an automatic stabilizer because of how the revenue is *used*, and not how it is *raised*.
Consumption is smoothed out as the incomes of laid-off workers are insured in the medium term.
Two problems remain:
First, laid-off workers can still consume less than they optimally should, maybe because they are anticipating a prolonged, uninsured downturn.
Second, unemployment insurance would be a much better automatic stabilizer if it were raised in a manner that also smoothes consumption.

#### A Mixed Bag For Capitalism.

On the pro side, a VAT and proportional payroll tax let entrepreneurs make their own production decisions, and on their own dime and incentive.

A VAT and proportional payroll tax also do not require , as disallowed by desideratum [\[des:liquid-assets\]](#des:liquid-assets){reference-type="ref" reference="des:liquid-assets"}.

On the other hand, a VAT and proportional payroll tax does little to avoid (page ff.).
If capital is concentrated in the hands of only a few people, the rest will not be able to close intelligently incentivized deals on their unobservable effort and uncertain innovations.

#### A Tiny Little Bit Difference Principle.

For all its equity and efficiency shortcomings, a proportional VAT shares the fundamental merit of all consumption taxes:
it taxes a normatively justifiable basis.
Taxing consumption, not incomes, may be desirable under the the , as per desideratum [\[des:difference-principle\]](#des:difference-principle){reference-type="ref" reference="des:difference-principle"}.
This is presented in greater detail and strength in [\[sec:foundational-beauty\]](#sec:foundational-beauty){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:foundational-beauty"} on the *Progressive* Consumption Tax.
Absent progression, the difference principle merits of the VAT are negligible.

The merit of consumption taxation under VAT also manifests itself in the (somewhat
[^10]
positive savings rate it allows for..
If government would raise its revenue exclusively through a VAT, people's incentive to save would be unaltered:
as argued in the above, a VAT is agnostic towards capital or labor incomes.

The Old Hand --- Direct, Progressive Taxes: PIT, CIT & Dual PIT {#sec:ScorePIT}
---------------------------------------------------------------

The [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} is the archetypical modern tax designed to redistribute.
It was conceived in the early to mid 19th century to address the inequities of early capitalism.

#### Income Taxation Punishes Saving.

A [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} can cause two different kinds of in desideratum [\[des:minimal-DWL\]](#des:minimal-DWL){reference-type="ref" reference="des:minimal-DWL"}.

First, if insufficiently progressive (= near proportional), it causes the discussed for VAT and payroll taxes (page ).

Second, if it is sufficiently progressive on both labor and capital incomes, it taxes savings twice:
once when they are earned, and a second time when they yield an interest (and yet again when they yield a compound interest).
This has a number of negative implications.

When people can avoid double taxation by consuming income right away, they may very well do so.
Capital incomes are taxed, even though saving is elastic.
This conflicts with desideratum [\[des:tax-inelastic\]](#des:tax-inelastic){reference-type="ref" reference="des:tax-inelastic"} ().
Things become even more awry when we consider investments (savings) of different risk.
When the (uncertain, but higher) rewards of risky investment are taxed progressively, people will have a smaller incentive to run the risk in the first place.
The PIT still allows for local, decentralized production decisions but incentives are substantially dampened.

A PIT discourages saving, and it falls twice on capital income, and only once on labor income.

#### The Merits of Progression.

It also serves to of labor as per desideratum [\[des:low-price-floor\]](#des:low-price-floor){reference-type="ref" reference="des:low-price-floor"}.
The problematic double taxation of capital incomes also serves to substantially dampen and ensures *some* degree of broad ownership.

#### The Limits of Progression Under the PIT.

A tax on *income*, by definition, does little to curb .

More fundamentally, a PIT does *not* allow for truly arbitrarily steep schedules.
For a high *average* tax rate on incomes say, 50%, *marginal* tax rates would be prohibitively high.
Such high marginal tax rates would all but destroy at that margin at all.
It seems likely that a PIT will be no match to the (page ), given its limited steepness in progression.

#### No Stabilization.

As any tax on income, the PIT cannot serve as an effective automatic or discretionary stabilizer.

#### The Systemic Flaws of the PIT.

Aside from its limited and problematic merits, the PIT carries with it some unavoidable, inherent flaws.

##### The PIT's Ugly or Unfair trade-off: Accrual vs. Realization.

Because the PIT is based on flows of economic welfare, it requires a method to measure these flows.
Whenever assets are illiquid
the taxman can either wait indefinitely for realization, or tax on some assumed accrual.
Either way, substantial welfare losses ensue and desideratum [\[des:liquid-assets\]](#des:liquid-assets){reference-type="ref" reference="des:liquid-assets"} on the is violated.

Income taxation on accrual or realization also has substantial equity implications.
In contrast to the VAT, it is *not* merely a matter of timing when we pay the income tax.

> "Such a statement reveals a basic failure to understand --- or a desire that others not understand --- the nature of income taxation and tax avoidance:
> \[...\] if income tax can be postponed \[...\], interest (or other capital income) can be earned on a tax deferred basis in the meantime."\
> --- McLure (1988 @Seidman1997 [125])

In short:
taxation on realization ignores compound interest.

##### Tax Evasion 101: Buy, Borrow, Die.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:TaxEvasion101\]]{#sec:TaxEvasion101 label="sec:TaxEvasion101"}
A sinister exploitation of the evaluation problem of the PIT goes by the name of *buy, borrow, die*.
[^11]

It emerges from the following three doctrines, all of which make sense in isolation.

First, a PIT never taxes debt as income.
It makes little sense to tax debt:
according to @Haig1921-@Simons1938 (equation eq:HaigSimons) and common intuition, the income-generating ability of a person does not change just because she takes out a loan.
Consequently, people pay their taxes on the income they use to repay principal and interest.

Second, for the practical reason of avoiding evaluations by a central planner, the PIT is levied on realization, not accrual.

Third, for @Haig1921-@Simons1938 and common intuition, heirs are (estate) taxed only net of assets and liabilities handed down to them.

So far so good?
These three trivially intuitive doctrines, in combination constitute the fatal achilles heel of effective capital income taxation.
Tax evaders can follow a simple, and entirely legal strategy.
First, they *buy* appreciating, but illiquid assets.
In a second step, they *borrow* money on the appreciating asset as collateral.
Recall that this cash inflow is not taxed.
Also recall that lenders may very well consider the yet-illiquid appreciation of the asset in extending their loan terms.
Tax evaders can now spend out of the appreciation of the asset without paying *any* capital income tax on this de-facto accrual of welfare.
Third, tax evaders *die* and bequest their assets to someone else.
That someone else is liable only for estate tax on the *net* value of the assets and liabilities.
The consumption of the deceased tax evader is deducted from the net value.
Again, ultimately, and irrevocably, consumed capital incomes escape taxation.

This loophole, like the underlying problem of , is *not* a practical aberration that could conceivably be closed.
Any income tax on realization will offer this evasive strategy.
<!-- %is this an entirely new problem, or does this fall adequately under "don't tax illiquid stuff?" Can I break it down like that?
%Or is there maybe another thing behind it?
%Timing?
%Is it all accrual vs realization? -->

This is not a hypothetical or esoteric problem.
The pre-2007 housing bubble in the U.S., Spain and elsewhere was --- amongst other factors --- also fueled by this strategy.
Houses were good illiquid assets (*buy*).
Banks willingly offered mortgages on the houses (*borrow*).
They also happily refinanced the loan, if the suggested (but unrealized!) fair market value of the house had increased.
Consumers took out a bigger mortgage on the (supposedly) appreciated house and spent the difference on a new SUV and a flat screen TV.
All tax free.

Appreciation in illiquid assets is no small component of our economic growth.
A colossal share of the real welfare that accrues to capital income earners escapes income taxation without further notice, and any readily available fix.

##### The PIT's Ugly Backstops: The Estate and Gift Tax.

It follows from the strategy of tax evasion 101 that an estate and gift tax are necessary backstops to the PIT.
Without a tax on the substance bequested, unrealized appreciations on illiquid assets would go entirely untaxed.
With an estate and gift tax, "only" the consumed part of unrealized appreciations escapes taxation.

The estate and gift taxes are, in themselves ugly beasts.
Just like the PIT, they require an evaluation of a flow of economic welfare in the potential absence of a market equilibrium price of that very flow.
If an entrepreneur bequests her family-owned firm to her daughter, no one can know how much it is worth.
Again, problems in the taxation of illiquid assets ensue.

##### The PIT's Ugly Backstops: The CIT.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:ScoreCIT\]]{#sec:ScoreCIT label="sec:ScoreCIT"}
A PIT has another, even uglier backstop:
the Corporate Income Tax.
Recall that a PIT is meant to tax all incomes, including interest and compound interest.
With only a PIT, tax evaders would have at their disposal a strategy even simpler than tax evasion 101:
they could place (or retain) their savings in an incorporated firm.
First, tax evaders could spread out their (spiky) income over a longer period of time to play the progressive schedule.
A small, but steady trickle of income is better than a large, lumpy flow under a progressive tax.
Second, and more fundamentally problematic, tax evaders can also retain their initial capital income in the corporation and have it earn a compound interest.
Note that the compound interest is earned on a capital income which, ideally, *should* have been taxed *already*.

To avoid this loophole, a PIT needs a CIT to get at the corporate shelter from the income tax [@Genschel2005 7].
Also empirically, PIT and CIT rates go hand in hand, between countries and over time, further supporting the intricate, if dysfunctional link between the two [@Piatkowski2008 14].

The CIT is as bad as the PIT, minus the merits of progressive, personal taxation of the PIT.

First, the CIT has no as demanded in desideratum [\[des:determined-incidence\]](#des:determined-incidence){reference-type="ref" reference="des:determined-incidence"} [@McCaffery2005 918].
Corporations are fictions.
If you tax them anyway, you violate desideratum [\[des:personal-taxation\]](#des:personal-taxation){reference-type="ref" reference="des:personal-taxation"} ().

Second and related, the CIT knows no progression.
To the extent the the CIT ever reliably fell on capital, it made some sense historically when corporate ownership was a reasonable proxy for the propertied classes.
This is no longer the case.
Many people receive capital incomes [@Grabka2007a XV].
The CIT has no way of distinguishing *between* different owners [@McCaffery2005 918].
Whether a particular Volkswagen share belongs to the life insurance of a single working mother or a stock market tycoon, both are taxed at some uniform corporate income rate .

Third, much like the PIT, the CIT itself is plagued by unavoidable loopholes.
The CIT is very sensitive to international tax rate competition:
if CIT rates differ from country to country, multinational companies can easily shift profits to the country with the lowest rate.
A number of strategies are available to do this, the simplest of which is to charge inflated (deflated) prices in intra-company trade [@Ganghof2004 43ff].
This loophole cannot be closed as inflation (deflation) of intra-company trade prices cannot be reliably detected.
More fundamentally, "any national claim to a particular share of \[a multinational's\] profits is hard to justify on the basis of principle" [@Genschel2005 61].
<!-- %also explain how they can always calculate themselves to zero, not just with arbitrage. -->

#### The Downgraded Upgrade: The Dual PIT.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:ScoreDualPIT\]]{#sec:ScoreDualPIT label="sec:ScoreDualPIT"}
To the extent that a Dual PIT has substantially lower, and proportional rates on capital incomes, it alleviates the PIT's disincentives to save and invest.
The Dual PIT is simply another non- relative burdening of capital and labor incomes in violation of desideratum [\[des:structural-agnosticism\]](#des:structural-agnosticism){reference-type="ref" reference="des:structural-agnosticism"}.

##### A Hollowed-Out PIT.

The relatively smaller burden on capital is hard to justify on principle.
The largest incomes are, by definition, capital incomes.
[^12]
Charging capital incomes a lower, proportional rate will greatly depress the overall progressivity of the PIT
Progression is limited under the PIT already, but will be even more compressed under a dual rate structure.

To the extent that more of the tax burden falls on labor, a Dual PIT will also raise the , as disallowed in desideratum [\[des:low-price-floor\]](#des:low-price-floor){reference-type="ref" reference="des:low-price-floor"}.

The Dual PIT is a PIT only in name.
It hollows out the ideal of universal progression.
The lower the rate on capital gets, the more a Dual PIT approximates a (progressive) payroll tax.

The Streaker --- Local Business Tax (LBT) {#sec:ScoreLBT}
-----------------------------------------

A tax on the earnings of local businesses shares all of the disadvantages of the CIT.

More fundamentally, the LBT is not a proper tax.
It should not need to be discussed here at all.

Local authorities provide different kinds of (see ).
The , and it provides should be financed out of general revenue.
A general revenue tax should fall only on as per desideratum [\[des:personal-taxation\]](#des:personal-taxation){reference-type="ref" reference="des:personal-taxation"}.

Local authorities also provide such as parks and such as sewers.
[^13]
Common good and natural monopolies should be financed out of Pigouvian levies (at marginal cost) and fees (at average cost), respectively.

The LBT sits in the nomansland somewhere between general revenue taxation and Pigouvian levy or fee.
It violates the norm of as per desideratum [\[des:ordoliberal-hygiene\]](#des:ordoliberal-hygiene){reference-type="ref" reference="des:ordoliberal-hygiene"}.

To the extent that the LBT is used to finances risk pools, public goods and redistributes, it should not be allowed to differ between municipalities.
If universal education is an allocative goal of the broader, national polity, everyone should pay for it.
<!-- %sometimes, such break-downs might be impractical, in that case, paying it out of general revenue might just be the better ticket. -->
If fire protection is a public good, everyone should pay for it.
LBT revenue used to finance these things should be replaced by transfers from higher levels of government.
<!-- %to avoid arbitrage
	%reference fiscal federalism -->

To the extent that the LBT is used to finance common goods or natural monopolies, it must specifically fall (at marginal or average cost, respectively) on the very consumption of these goods, and not on the earnings of a firm in general.
If industry pollutes a local river, *every unit of discharged pollution* should be (Pigouvian) taxed at marginal cost, not every firm in the city based on their earnings.
If some firms or citizens in a rural municipality require high-speed internet access (a natural monopoly), each *user* of the network should pay at average costs, not every firm in the vicinity.
Also note that LVT can replace this purpose to some extent.

In short, the LBT is an anti-ordoliberal streaker that should never have entered this game of perfect taxation.
It should be marshaled off the playing field as soon as possible.

## Deliberation and Democracy

Why does deliberating taxation matter for democracy?

A dysfunctional mixed economy without good taxes may produce illegitimate outputs, and, in so far as it disturbs the state-market balance of the mixed economy, violates output congruence of a democracy [compare @Zurn-2000-aa 190].
Yet, even if experts could agree on a tax --- such as a promising, post-paid, cash-flow based [pct]{acronym-label="pct" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- the tradeoffs involved in choosing or calibrating a tax regime are irreducibly political.
For example, experts cannot *positively* inquire whether economic "growth" [^positive_sum] is in itself *virtuous*, which inter-subjective aggregation would be *utility-maximizing*, what *deontological* rights owners have or which human *relationships* should be governed by prices or command at all --- even if they could agree on any of those alternative ethics.

[^positive_sum]: More precisely, the reaping of greater non-zero-sumness from social integration [@Wright2000].

<!-- TODO these are all discussed in *wanted* chapter -->
<!-- Even to the extent that tax choice can be left to economic a-priori or empirical analyses, of, for example, \glspl{dwl}, such expertise relies on contentious views of human nature \citep[for a review,][]{Persky1995}, and observations of nature are, in any event, devoid of moral messages \citep[43]{Gould1982}. -->
These metaphysical conundrums are reflected in very concrete, technocratic issues in taxation.
<!-- TODO add complete list here, those are old links issues in taxation, including \glspl{dwl} (p.~\pageref{sec:tax-optimality}), \hyperref[sec:diminishing-marginal-utility]{diminishing marginal utility} (p.~\pageref{sec:diminishing-marginal-utility}), the \hyperref[des:structural-agnosticism]{treatment of capital income} (p.~\pageref{des:structural-agnosticism}), or \hyperref[sec:love-marriage]{joint spousal taxation} (p.~\pageref{sec:love-marriage}), respectively. -->
Likewise, experts cannot justify the axioms on which their (economic) analyses rest:
whether, and under which institutional circumstances we are homines oeconomici, cannot be exhaustively answered from observation, because nature provides no intelligible moral messages on what kind of man we *should* be [@Gould1982 43].
<!-- again reference wanted chapter -->
This ontological stance matters for tax, too:
for an expert to model a general equilibrium is to invoke, as well as to make, a homo economicus.

Of all conceivable institutions to resolve these disagreements, deliberative --- not aggregative, not pluralist, not participatory --- democracy offers the greatest normative appeal, because these disagreements raise, in @Habermas-1984's words, competing *validity claims*, in need of argumentative redemption, as in:
is "growth" *comprehensible*, who *truly* bears a [cit]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="singular+short"}, is homo economicus *right*, and are social insurance employer co-payments *truthful*?
I illustrate further more, and less valid claims on taxation.
<!-- %I illustrate further more -- language does not work -->
<!-- TODO referer to validity-claims tex table here! -->
<!-- TODO INPUT validity claims table here! -->

Liberal democracy, born out of the hope that material inequality and political autonomy *can* be reconciled, especially, rests on deliberation, because if anywhere, it is in taxation that money and power may have replaced language to govern meaning and action [@Habermas-1971].
In fact, if you wanted to hide some process of (re)producing inequality anywhere, you could hardly find a better place than the intricacies of (income) taxation (consider, for example "tax planning 101" in @McCaffery2005 [888]).

Instead of communicative action [@Habermas-1984], what emerges today from citizens, their legislatures and public spheres, may be more "analytic muddle of tax" [@McCaffery2005 862].
The beliefs held and issues considered in the public [for example, @Caplan2007], appear to bear little resemblance to the abstractions suggested by economists [for example, @Harberger1974].
People seem to ignore fundamental choices in tax [for example, @McCafferyHines2010], and may fall for inconsequential alternatives [for example, @SausgruberTyran2011], possibly even err systematically against their own material interest --- if they are on the lower economic rungs [for a German example, @Kemmerling2009].
Here, too, (input) congruence of democratic rule may be violated if and to the extent that people are confused about policy choices [compare @Zurn-2000-aa 90].

<!-- %Value research points to increasing disaffection of voters, not with democracy as a system of rule, but with the institutions and performance of real-existing, sustained democracies \citep{Dalton-2004-aa}
%\footnote{
	%Dalton (ibid.) has pointed out that voter disaffection may in fact be regarded as democratically desirable, if we hold it to be indicators of critical citizen oversight of governance.
%This assumption --- that changing evaluation criteria may be for the better of democracy --- has some merit, but does not warrant inaction.
%Except to a very cold-hearted, and epistemologically narrow mind of rational choice, dwindling voter turnout (ibid.) must be alarming everyone that, if this ``snake [does not] shed its skin, [it may well] perish.'' (Antoine de Saint-Exup\'ery, The Little Prince).
%In any case, the material deficiencies and inequalities of our world point to political systems that are not beyond improvement.}.

%Explanations for voter disaffection and perceived underperformance vary, invoking amongst others ``government overload'' \citep{HuntingtonInternational-Affairs.-1968-aa}, ``post-material'' or ``emancipative'' change and dimensions of values \citep{InglehartWelzel-2005-aa}, mind-boggling ``reflexive modernization'' \citep{BeckGiddens-1994-aa} or a democratic deficit inducing ``denationalization'' {Zurn-2000-aa}.

%I employ here \citeauthor{PutnamPharr-2000-aa}'s \citeyearpar{PutnamPharr-2000-aa} model to explain decreasing citizen confidence in government and political institutions.
%As relevant ``boundary conditions'', they list increased \emph{information} about the flaws of the political process ``post-Watergate'', and heightened \emph{evaluation criteria} due to either, or both, rising and diverging expectations.
%Citizens then assess the performance of representative democratic institutions, which is in turn a product of the \emph{capacity and competence}, the \emph{social capital} and \emph{fidelity} of the governors.
%The capacity and competence refers to the \emph{ability} of governments to choose and to implement policies in the interest of their citizens, highlights a routinized decision-making process as such and points to a systemic level of analysis.
%Fidelity is an individual-level determinant of government performance, focusing on the incidental misconduct.
%Social capital affects performance as a ``civic lubricant'' as an infrastructure, or network of generalized trust between individuals. -->

<!-- %\subparagraph{Capacity} By capacity, I understand the \emph{ability} of democratic rule \emph{to act} in the interest of the people, that is, in the last instance, the ability to enforce collectively binding decisions.
%This reflects \citeauthor{Zurn-2000-aa}'s (\citeyear{Zurn-2000-aa}:
%188) notion of congruency between the social and the political spaces, where inputs and outputs of both realms must always occur at the same level.
%In simpler words:
%an input incongruence occurs (for example, disenfranchised illiterates), where people are affected by a political decision (or non-decision) of their own polity, in the making of which they had no say and an output incongruence (for example, international tax competition) is given when a polity is affected by a dynamic, over which it has no jurisdiction. -->


<!-- %\subparagraph{Competence} By competence, I understand the ability to \emph{reason} on and \emph{identify} \emph{policies} that are in the interest of the people, and, conversely, those, that are not --- and why.

%The distinction between capacity and competence --- in reality as in the following discussion --- is not as clear-cut as here stipulated.
%Where capacities are constrained, even a competent discussion is likely to anticipate which decisions are impossible to collectively enforce, and thereby retract on other ``second-best'' solutions.
%Conversely, a capacity to organize a public good hardly makes sense abstracted from, or in the absence of a competent understanding of its very possibility.
%The distinction therefore serves rather to structure the argument from different, albeit not entirely orthogonal angles. -->

%\subsection{Preference Aggregation in Liberal, Representative Democracy}
%Liberal, representative democracy, rests on a pluralist theory of governance (\citealt{Louw2005}:15).
%Pluralism, being both empirical hypothesis and normative prescription supposes that political power is, and \emph{should} be widely dispersed among society's interest groups.
%These interest groups, made up of ever active citizens, openly compete with one another, thereby preventing any one of them to become a dominant elite.

%Institutional manifestations of pluralism abound in today's real existing democracies, both of the majoritarian and consociational type \citep{Lijphart-1999-aa}, including the right to form parties, (particularistic) associations, minority protection as well as constitutional checks-and-balances on government.

%\subsection{An Economic Theory of Democracy}
%Anthony \cite{Downs-1957-aa}, in his seminal spatial modeling of democratic competition, expanded pluralism into a democratic theory of public choice, based on the rational self-interest of both voters (to live under policies they prefer) and politicians or parties (seeking or maintaining political power).
%\begin{figure}
%	\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{Downs-Median-Voter}
%\label{fig:Downs-Median-Voter}
%\caption{The Median Voter (Downs 1957:
%118)}
%\end{figure}

%\paragraph{The Median Voter}In its simplest form, reproduced in \autoref{fig:Downs-Median-Voter}, the ``Economic Theory of Democracy'' suggests that in a unimodal, unidimensional and symmetric distribution of voter preferences under a single-member plurality (SMP) electoral system, only two parties will compete for the median voter, taking on a central position only marginally different from one another.
%Any new parties or otherwise diversions from the median position would quickly move towards that equilibrium position again.

%Downs provides a theory, explaining how differing preferences and disjunct interest groups get channeled into fewer parties and stable equilibrium.

%\paragraph{The Median Voter\emph{s}}In Downs' defense from often misconceived reiterations and undue criticism:
%his theory, misleadingly reduced to a ``Median Voter Theorem'' does \emph{not} stop here.
%He employs his theory to a wide range of given preference distributions and electoral systems, including multimodal distributions (with \emph{several}, local median voters), multiparty competition under proportional representation and antecedent coalition government.
%He even suggests, in a prelude to the much later ``issue'' literature (for instance \citealt{Abbe2003}), that parties may choose to ``sprinkle'' their position over a number of issues, so as to appeal to a broader electorate (\citealt[137]{Downs-1957-aa}).

%\paragraph{In a Nutshell \ldots} What remains of Downs' theory, and is of central importance here is distilled in the following axioms:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{Voter preferences can be modelled on a \emph{single dimension}.}
%	\item{Voter preferences are \emph{presocial}, or given \emph{ex-ante}.}
%	\item{The mode of party competition is a function of the voter preference distribution and the electoral system.}
%	\item{In the equilibrium, any mode of the preference distribution is occupied by a party, so as long as the electoral system threshold allows for another party.}
%\end{enumerate}

%\subsection{The Good Old Days:
%Late-Modern Pluralist Political Competition}
%Both \cite{Lazarsfeld1968} study of the 1940 U.S.\ presidential campaign and \cite{LipsetRokkan-1967-aa} historical account of party systems and voter alignments serve well as a contrasting foil for the post-pluralist critique to come.

%\paragraph{Erie County, OH, c.a.
%1940}Let's begin with Lazarsfeld, who in 1940 set out to study how voters made up their mind in Erie County, OH.
%He found a highly stable, neatly aligned political spectrum.
%77\% of the voters, he found, voted as their parents and grandparents had (\emph{ibid.}:
%xxxiii).
%People thought politically, as they were, socially:
%``social characteristics determine political preference'' (\emph{ibid.}:
%27) in that long past rural county.
%Also, and most significantly for the criticism to come, Lazarsfeld found that:
%\begin{quote} \emph{A very large majority of \textbf{both} groups thought that it would be the common man, the plain people, the working class, who would benefit if Roosevelt were elected.
%\textbf{Both} groups also agreed, although not to the same extent, that Willkie's victory would be best for the business class.\\ \citealt[28, emphasis added]{Lazarsfeld1968}.}
%\end{quote}
%Where campaigns where influential, they acted to make voting \emph{more} consistent with the social group of the voters (\emph{ibid.}:
%139).

%This is of course a finding very much in line with the modeling assumption of \cite{Downs-1957-aa}:
%voter preferences seemed to differ on a single dimension, and, to a large extent, where given.

%\paragraph{Where You Stand on an Issue Depends on Where You Sit \ldots}
%\cite{LipsetRokkan-1967-aa} provide a broader history of social cleavages and and antecedent voter alignments and party systems, of which the ``worker'' --``business'' nexus in Erie County is only the last of a number of stages.
%Analyzing the history of political competition in Europe, they lay out a dialectic of conflict and integration, ranging from early modern centre-periphery and church-state struggles to early-industrial urban-rural and late-industrial owner-worker conflict (\emph{ibid.}:
%93).
%These evolving cleavages, in their account, shape and diversify preferences and parties as new ones layer on past ones, slowly fading away.
%While their historical analysis is limited to Europe, a broader insight remains:
%how, at least in the past, political preferences and parties followed broader patterns of socio-economic difference and bifurcation\footnote{It should be noted that \cite{LipsetRokkan-1967-aa} with their suggestion of layered, cross-cutting cleavages, do of course stand in sharp contrast with \cite{Downs-1957-aa} assumption of a unidimensional preferences space.
%The implications of this early, conceptual disagreement with Downs are however of little relevance to the argument presented here.}.

%\paragraph{No Nostalgia\ldots}
%To be clear, not all was good in Erie County, OH, c.a.
%1940.
%These neatly-aligned voters, following more their family tradition than their own thinking, were far away from to the ideal of a well-informed, active citizen.
%The socio-economic determination of the preferences they displayed are the vert politics of zero-sum redistribution, which all too often result in violent strife and the destruction of a democratic system.
%This bifurcated electorate is the very antithesis to those cross-cutting cleavages that at least the consociational theorists of democracy cherish so much \citep{Lijphart-1999-ab}.

%\paragraph{\ldots and yet:
%it \emph{Worked}}
%Its non-emancipated voters and explosive configuration notwithstanding, some key characteristics of this late modern political competition seem worthy do condense, building on the aforementioned axioms of Downs:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{Political preferences are presocial, given ex-ante.}
%	\item{Political preferences are determined by socio-economic status.}
%	\item{Political parties compete on differential policies, geared to different socio-economic strata, but on the same dimension.}
%\end{enumerate}

%\section{A Doubtful Demand Side:
%The Woes of the Rational Voter}

%\subsection{Our Dumb Voters:
%Non-Attitudes}
%The first grain of normative and conceptual doubt in the reliability of a Downsian, pluralist aggregation machine comes from \citeauthor{Converse-1970-aa}'s \citeyear{Converse-1970-aa} seminal work on ``Attitudes and Non-Attitudes''.
%In his panel studies, he finds that a substantial sub-group of voters has entirely random attitudes on, amongst others, the relative role of government and the market, with close to zero correlations between test and retest.
%This result, Converse warns, holds even when respondents were encouraged \emph{not} to respond.
%Moreover, the subgroup that displays random attitudes is more likely to report extreme attitudes in either direction.

%Less elegantly modeled, but more broadly applied findings come from a vast array of public opinion surveys, aptly summarized by \cite{Delli-CarpiniKeeter-1996-aa}.
%Findings suggest that many voters do not have even the most basic knowledge of political processes or platforms.

%A discussion of the complications and questions that arise from this area of research is beyond the scope if this treatment, and with limited relevance to the question at hand.

%It remains to be noted that the Downsian \citeyearpar{Downs-1957-aa} assumption of pre-social, unidimensional preferences, and to an even greater extent, Lazarfeld's \citeyearpar{Lazarsfeld1968} findings of socio-economically determined preferences, may no longer apply given widespread ignorance of voters.

%More generally, these findings cast doubt on the liberal assumption that an \emph{electoral} democracy with pre-social preferences and particularistic interest representation will achieve socially optimal decisions.

%\subsection{\emph{Rational Ignorance} to the Rescue}
%Theorists of Rational Choice respond to these doubts by pointing out that ignorance may well be rational, given how small a chance an individual vote stands to turn the election (particularly under SMP) \citep{Olson-1971-aa}, and that largely ignorant masses can still produce socially optimal outcomes if their errors are random \citep{Page1993, Surowiecki2004}.

%While I find the pride, that evangelists of Rational Choice take in the Olsonian escape from participation quite dubious, a broader appraisal of the merits and problems of Rational Choice is beyond the scope of this piece.

%It will suffice to accept their framework of human motivation and to simply question the empirical validity of the ``Wisdom of Crowds''.
%This argument presented by a host of authors (see above), and recently popularized by \cite{Surowiecki2004} proceeds as follows:
%if all those ignorant voters cancel each other out in their \emph{random} aberations from the socially optimal, the remaining, knowledgeable voters will decide the election, as \emph{their} choices will differ \emph{systematically} from the mean.

%\subsection{What if Errors are Systematic?}
%Bryan \cite{Caplan2007} has recently provided ample evidence and a compelling framework to cast doubt on this assumption.
%In his passionate dismantling of ``The Myth of the Rational Voter'', he describes how uneducated opinions on economic matters will \emph{systematically} differ from the average, following what he describes as an \emph{antimarket}, \emph{antiforeign}, \emph{make-work} and \emph{pessimistic} bias.

%If \citeauthor{Caplan2007} is right, and voters do in fact err systematically on matters which they understand inadequately, there will be no Wisdom of the Crowds, but instead a tyranny of the biased masses.

%\subsection{What if the Value Space is \emph{N}-Dimensional?}
%Another set of empirical finding incompatible with \cite{Downs-1957-aa} assumption comes from political sociology, where an entire field of sophisticated surveys and competing theories has evolved, probing into the dimensionality and change of the postindustrial value space.

%It will suffice to point to one set of findings here.
%In their work, \cite{InglehartWelzel-2005-aa} not only single-handedly integrate value change into a reanimated version of modernization theory, they also provide a host of empirical findings from the World Values Surveys, showing that, at the least, the value space is now two-dimensional, with an axis of traditional vs.\ secular-rational values, and a second axis of survival vs.\ self-expression values.
%The authors describe a wide-reaching change in direction, from the former pre-modern to modern dimension to the latter modern to postmodern dimension, but note that this is neither an irreversible nor universal process and that in any given society, people will differ on more than one dimension.
%Other, broadly corroborating findings come from \cite{FlanaganLee-2003-aa}, who explicitly relates value change to a complication in political competition and \cite{Schwartz-1994-ab}, who suggests a whole circle\footnote{The problem of visualizing more than two dimensions in a \emph{circle} is duly noted.
%From statistical work for Chris Welzel, this author can attest to the apparent necessity to (overly) simplify empirical findings of the value space until they are readily presentable in two-dimensional form.
%Such multidimensional scaling and forced factor analyses at almost all cost in terms of model fit, to the author, indeed appears to be a troubling habit of value research.} of independent dimensions.

%\subsection{Problems with Downs}
%From these empirical findings and conceptual refinements arise a number of potential incompatibilities with Downs model of political competition and antecedent, optimistic ideas of socially optimal public choice under pluralist democracy:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{A substantial subset of voters appears to harbor irrational, and systematically skewed beliefs.
%A simple aggregation of preferences appears unlikely to result in socially optimal policies.}
%	\item{Any given postindustrial electorate is likely to differ on more than one dimension in their political preferences.}
%\end{enumerate}

%These incompatibilities alone, albeit preliminary in nature, would require a thorough rethinking of pluralist prescriptions and analyses of liberal, representative democracy undergoing Downsian aggregation.

%\begin{quote}
%	\emph{I'm a little angry that I apparently was voting in a completely different election than most of the country.
%I thought we were having a rational discussion about how best to protect ourselves in perilous times ---\\ and actually, it was a referendum on boys kissing.}\\\\

%\end{quote}

%Speaking in economic terms, the preceding section dealt with questions regarding the \emph{demand side} of \citeauthor{Downs-1957-aa}'s \citeyear{Downs-1957-aa} ``Economic Theory of Democracy'':
%the condition and abilities of voters.

%In the following, I want to direct the view to the \emph{supply side} of political competition:
%to the parties and candidates that compete for majorities and to the campaigns they wage.

%\subsection{A Neo-Downsian Theory of Dysfunctional Political Competition}

%To hypothesize a Neo-Downsian Theory of Dysfunctional Political Competition, accounting for and problematizing the above described dynamics in political campaigning, I add to \cite{Downs-1957-aa} model specification the following:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{Voters differ in their preferences on a number of mutually orthogonal dimensions.}
%	\item{Voters differ in the importance they assign to different dimensions.}
%	\item{Voters differ in the importance they assign to positions \emph{along} one dimension.}
%	\item{Parties can choose which dimension(s) to campaign on.
%No agreement on dimensions is necessary.}
%	\item{Campaigning is costly.}
%	\item{Costs are the financial and otherwise efforts required to activate or convince a voter of any party given position on any given dimension.}
%	\item{Dimensions have different cost functions.}
%	\item{Cost functions are allowed to take any form, independent from the preference distribution, and including skewed and/or multimodal.
%(See \autoref{fig:Neodowns})}
%	\item{Parties aim to maximize their utility function, where marginal costs of campaigning are same as marginal vote increases.}
%\end{enumerate}

%\begin{figure}
%	\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{NeoDowns}
%\label{fig:Neodowns}
%\caption{The Median Voter (Downs 1957:
%118), with an inverse cost function overlaid.
%For more intuitive appeal, the overlaid function is \emph{not} the cost function, but the propensity of voters at the given position to be activated or convinced by a campaign.}
%\end{figure}

%It is unfortunately beyond my abilities to completely visualize the multidimensional model specified in the above, which would also have to be fully specified in formal math for further elaboration.

%For illustration, I have merely overlaid a hypothetical cost functions to Downs classic graph in \autoref{fig:Neodowns}.

%\paragraph{Introducing Variable Costs of Campaigning} It is first assumed that voters do in fact, vary in their preferences on more than one dimension.
%The number of, and potential correlations between dimensions (making them less than completely orthogonal in a multidimensional scaling) is of no concern here.
%Furthermore, the costs and rewards of campaigning are overlaid on Downs model.
% It is assumed that the effort required to activate (GOTV) or convince a voter vary as a function of her position on the chosen dimension.
%It is furthermore assumed that these cost functions differ in their overall integral as well as their shape:
%some dimensions are cheaper to campaign on overall, and some positions on some dimensions are easier to communicate than others.

%The above model specifications also allow voter preferences to vary in importance \emph{across} different and \emph{along} single dimensions.
%It is assumed here that these differences in assigned importance of voters are fully captured in the cost functions of the parties.
%This is a reasonable simplification:
%voters will be more easily (and cheaply) activated on positions and/or dimensions they already feel strongly about.

%\paragraph{How Will Parties Act} The incentives for parties to act are then substantially complicated.
%They will no longer, as \cite{Downs-1957-aa} assumed, simply compete for a vote share around some mode in the unidimensional preference distribution.
%Instead, given their budget constraint, they will choose their positions on, and dimensions they compete on, as a function of their campaigning costs and the chances to activate or convince a voter.
%In simple terms:
%they will campaign so as to maximize the ballot bang for their buck.

%From these incentives then emerges a rationale to choose positions \emph{between} preference distribution modes (the classical Median Voter prescription) and nereby, \emph{local} minima in the cost of campaigning function, or conversely, \emph{local} maxima of importance assigned by voters.

%Parties will multiply the ex-ante preference distribution with the costs of campaigning function and solve for that position that offers the best ratio of votes for campaign money invested.
%Exogenous budget constraints of parties may further alter this calculation.

%\paragraph{Introducing Strategic interaction}
%Choosing party platforms, and campaign positions is of course, as \cite{Downs-1957-aa} pointed out, a \emph{strategic interaction}, or simply:
%a game.
%The rationale of one party to choose a position depends, amongst other things, on the chosen positions and dimensions of all competing parties.

%This further complicates party incentives.
%As parties in an election --- per definition --- care about \emph{relative} payoffs, rather than \emph{absolute} payoffs, they will choose positions and dimensions, which, based on the real or anticipated campaigning of competing parties, will offer them the relatively highest ballot bang for the available campaign buck.

%\subsection{Different Dimensions for Different Voters}
%\paragraph{Converse, Redux:
%A Sweet Spot for Dumb Voters?}
%This model becomes more tangible and persuasive when interpreted in light of \citeauthor{Converse-1970-aa}'s \citeyearpar{Converse-1970-aa} insights.
%His subset of ``random'' voters appears to be more likely to be easily swayed by campaigns on dimensions \emph{different} from the mainstream of political competition than those ``systematic'' voters who held reliable, and potentially educated beliefs on the relative role of government and the market.

%Without conceptually stretching Converse's finding too far, they can at minimum be interpreted as support for the model's specification that different groups of people can relate with different ease and reliability to different dimensions.
%In political campaigning, that ease and reliability translates into campaign spending required to harvest voters.

%Converse's staple item on the relative roles of government and the market, appears to be a suitable dimension to appeal to some, educated voters who will \emph{systematically} respond to positions taken by competing parties.
%Other voters, who have displayed \emph{randomly} changing attitudes on the subject matter are unlikely to be reliably activated or persuaded by campaigns on this dimension.
%For them, in particular, other dimensions unbeknownst to Converse may be more suitable.

%Note also that the second, uneducated group of voters may be \emph{per se} more interesting to political campaigns:
%with relatively less developed political attitudes, and party alignment they constitute a battle ground where potentially, with the right, effective dimensions chosen, many more votes are at stake for political campaigns.
%By contrast, the group of educated voters with systematic and stable responses on the government-market dimension may be hard to win over, and relatively ineffective to mobilize given the typically higher turnout among these voters.

%In the language of the proposed model, the first, uneducated groups may provide a number of dimensions on which cost functions have a relatively small integral, or provide concentrated, ``sweet spots'' where a large number of voters can be reached with little effort.
%Put provocatively, dumb voters may just provide parties with more bang for the buck.

%\paragraph{False Class Consciousness, Redux:
%Screwing \emph{Joe the Plumber}}\footnote{No pun intended.}

%\begin{quote}
%	\emph{It's not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them, or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.}\\\\
%	Barack H.~Obama at a closed-door fundraiser in 2008, referring to the economically disadvantaged, sparking off the ``Bittergate'' controversy.
%\end{quote}

%While Barack Obama's comment in the 2008 primaries may be regarded as strategically unwise, it's sociological intuition does point to more worrisome implications of the above-mentioned dynamics.
%Political sophistication, like education in general, of course tends to correlate with socio-economic status.
%Richer, better-off people tend to have more systematic political attitudes and more knowledge of policy and process.

%I does not take a Marxist view of class or history to understand that this correlation, taken together with the greater and cheaper electoral benefits that relatively uneducated voters stand to offer, may blanket out from the political competition the interests of the underprivileged.

%\emph{Joe the Plumber}, who during the 2008 campaign criticized Barack Obama's tax cuts as being ``socialist'' and erroneously believed that he himself were to be disadvantaged by Obama's plan, is now a proverbial shorthand for screwing the poor in discourse and campaigning.

%The above model hypothesizes a compelling dynamic that could explain the systematic errors of attribution of their misfortune, to which Joe the Plumber and bitter Rust Belters fall prey.
%It may just be cheaper for parties to appeal to gun ownership, anti-foreign sentiment and religiosity rather than address head-on the economic condition of these unsystematic voters, whose redistributive repercussions, in turn, may alienate other, more systematic and richer voters.

%Moreover, and without a historical-materialist conspiracy theory in mind, a critical analysis must ask whom this dynamic benefits in the broader socio-economic scheme of things.

%\subsection{A Race to the Bottom of Impoverished Politics}

%\paragraph{Some Speculation, Some Informed Intuitions}
%Granted, much of the above critical application of an hypothesized neo-Downsian theory of dysfunctional political competition is in the realm of speculation, and far outstretches the empirical findings of \cite{Converse-1970-aa} and others.

%Particularly the concern about a possibly resultant socio-economic uncoupling belongs into the realm of empirical testing, not self-righteous certainty.

%And yet, some informed intuitions remain uncomfortably plausible.
%If voters do indeed differ in the degree of their political sophistication, then those relatively uneducated voters may provide parties with a fruitful battle ground, if on different dimensions.

%What are these dimensions going to be all about?
%By definition, they will try to persuade and mobilize voters on preference spaces and positions that are relatively easy to communicate and understand.

%\paragraph{Cooperation Problem on the High Road}
%There remain little reason why these easily communicated dimensions should then retain any meaningful relation to the true \emph{Public Choices} of our common polities.
%A political competition on preferences remote to the actual policy alternatives ahead, is, in fact, reasonably unlikely to foster the common good, as pluralist and liberal theorists of democracy had hoped.

%What could emerge, is a \emph{Prisoner's Dilemma} game between parties and our wider polity, where going the easy, cheap and low road, is always a dominant strategy, given the broader and more concentrated benefits that it provides vis-a-vis the widely distributed costs of socially suboptimal policy.
%The payoff matrix of such a Prisoner's Dilemma with approximate strategic choices is reproduced in \autoref{tab:BottomRace}.
%It includes, for illustration, examples policies easy to communicate for the Republicans and Democrats, compared to payoffs for a political competition on ``alternative conceptions of the common good'' (\citealt{Cohen-1989-aa}:
%23)\footnote{This payoff matrix is not a well-defined model of a strategic interaction, but rather an illustration of an intuited race to the bottom dynamic.
%In its complete strategic form, the payoff matrix would have to account for a greater number or different specification of players, where the costs of socially suboptimal policy are accrued not to the parties, but, as they are in fact, to the entire population.}.

%\subsection{Past and Current Conditions of Public Choice and Socio-Economic Structure}
%Comparing this model to the foil of late-modern political competition documented by \cite{Lazarsfeld1968}, one vexing question arises:
%why would political competition have been any less dysfunctional in the 1940s than today?

%Surely, voters were no more --- probably a lot less --- sophisticated than today, and parties were as self-interested as ever.
%And yet, from the almost idyllic account of Erie County, OH, emerges the idea of a somewhat functional political competition between Roosevelt and Willkie.

%One must be careful not to idealize the past, and in particular, the politics of the 1940s.
%These were, as described in the above, seemingly idyllic, but also times of suppression, unquestioned authority, tradition and unyielding socio-economic division, all overcome today.

%What makes Roosevelt vs.\ Willkie a fairer fight, even given its ``proto-democratic'' playing field, is that the policy alternatives of the day were sufficiently crude so as to be easily, and cheaply communicated.
%As \citeauthor{Lazarsfeld1968} (\citeyear{Lazarsfeld1968}:
%28) chronicle:
%\begin{quote}\emph{A very large majority of \textbf{both} groups thought that it would be the common man, the plain people, the working class, who would benefit if Roosevelt were elected.
%Both groups also agreed, although not to the same extent, that Willkie's victory would be best for the business class}.
%\end{quote}

%At the time, as \cite{LipsetRokkan-1967-aa} describe, this capital-labor cleavage was indeed still the dominant socio-economic fault line.
%Surely, other issues, such as U.S.\ intervention in the war and the respective fitness for office of the candidates were also important --- and arguably much harder to decide.
%But still, one preference dimension at least remained on which people could easily, and appropriately locate.
%For at the time, redistributive interventions (New Deal, worker rights, progressive income tax) in the mass late-industrial bifurcation of ownership of the means of production, were in fact predominant, and \emph{real} Public Choices.

%In game theoretic terms, campaigning on late-industrialist redistribution was a \emph{dominant} strategy, which, because it was so cheap to communicate and resonated so well, would pay, no matter what the other party did.

%Today, I argue, the Public Choices and socio-economic structures of a postindustrial economy are much too complex to be easily communicated.
%Redistributive alternatives, or, more topically, questions of \emph{equal opportunity} remain, to be sure.
%But in a time of widespread ownership of the means of production (think:\ private insurance, pensions) and increasing international competition (think:\ offshoring), answers are more complicated.

%These are questions on which even professional economists can reasonably disagree on, as the common adage goes, and surely, communicating their vexing complexity is no easy business for a campaigner --- especially, when the opponent takes the low road.

%The redistributive positions and dimensions that \emph{are} campaigned on by todays parties are so obviously misleading in their empty sloganeering that not even the faintest relation to substantive policy, let alone socio-economic interests of voters can be ascertained.

%To name just a few from recent German debates and campaigns:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{Is a smaller net/gross tax gap really good for everyone, when the balance is paid through an increasing (degressive) VAT?}
%	\item{Is a minimum wage really good for the working poor and unemployed people if it risks greater unemployment?}
%	\item{Is a cash-for-clunkers scheme really good for the environment and the broader economy?}
%\end{enumerate}

%In fact, just from a cursory evaluation of these, and many other widely communicated policies, it appears that their greatest merit may lie in their very simplicity and intuitive feel --- and not so much their quality and appropriateness.

%This is now the very condition of a globalized, postindustrial economy and society, where individual life chances and the collective good are determined by complex, mutually reinforcing, often non-linear causalities, with ever greater interdependencies between the parts and the whole.

%To this world, it appears, a political competition between self-interested parties, following dominant strategies to campaign on the cheapest dimension available, is a uniquely poor match.

%\section{A Reality Check:
%Political Campaigning Today}
%Changes in the available technologies and methods for political campaigns are of course another corollary of that complexly interacting, and ever progressing world.
%These very innovations of political campaigning could be understood as enabling a dysfunctional race to the bottom.

%In the following, I list and critically evaluate recent developments in campaigning in the light of an hypothesized theory of neo-Downsian political competition.

%\subsection{Accounts of Changing Political Campaigning}
%\subsubsection{Deconstructing the Hype}
%A vague air of dysfunction much in line with the hypothesized dynamic presented in the above emerges, for example, from \citeauthor{Louw2005}'s \citeyearpar{Louw2005} account of ``The Media and Political Process''.
%He warns that we increasingly inhabit a world of secondhand, (mediated) images which we naturalize as `the way things are'.
%In classic constructivist manner, he asks to `de-naturalize' these image, and render visible the conditions and rationales of their production.
%While more concerned with the highly professionalized scripting (or constructing) of hypes, Louw's culture pessimism of the constructivist kind can also be construed (no pun intended) as a critique of competing on easily communicated dimensions:
%\begin{quote}\emph{Those scripting hype politics are concerned with agenda setting --- i.e.\ trying to direct the gaze of the public away from issues that might prove problematic for policy makers, and directing their gaze towards issues deemed helpful for steering society in the direction desired by policy elites.}
%(\citealt{Louw2005}:
%274)
%\end{quote}

%Constructivists have long described the efforts of \emph{identity entrepreneurs} --- or issue entrepreneurs -- as a self-interested project of constructing meaning \citep{Brubaker-2002-aa}.
%Borrowing \citeauthor{Weber-1918-aa}'s \citeyearpar{Weber-1918-aa} classic adage, these entrepreneurs live \emph{for} as well as \emph{off} the issues and identities they construct.
%In the proposed neo-Downsian theory of dysfunctional political competition, much the same can be said of self-interested parties, choosing and testing positions and preference dimensions.

%\subsubsection{Issues are Non-Issues}
%The recently evolving literature of \emph{issue-based} campaigning, properly re-interpreted also provides some support for the hypothesized neo-Downsian dynamic.
%The theory specified here, however, also suggests that this field of research should denaturalize its concepts and should adopt a fundamentally more critical perspective.

%Quite trivially, \cite{Abbe2003} report that voters are more likely to support candidates and parties with whom they agree on the importance of issues, for example centering a campaign on either restoring moral and ethical standards (Republican owned) or improving education (Democratic owned).
%They conclude from their analysis of staffer-reported campaign issues and vote shares in the 1998 U.S.\ House of Representatives election that issues are superseding socio-economic status, and almost happily advise that candidates ``dominating the issue agenda enjoy important advantages at the polls'' (\citeyear[428]{Abbe2003}).

%\citeauthor{Abbe2003}'s \citeyearpar{Abbe2003} work on issue voting is fraught with a number of troubling misconceptions.

%Most importantly, they naturalize the list of issues presented to them uncritically, and make the campaign staffer sloganeering on ``education, social security, taxes, the economy, health care and moral/ethical standards'' (\emph{ibid.}:
%421) part of their analytical toolkit.
%You do not have to be a hardcore constructivist to endorse its lesson that such concepts are indeed ``what we want to explain, not what we want to explain things \emph{with}'' \citep[165]{Brubaker-2002-aa}, emphasis in original).
%In fact, one would expect that it does not take more than common sense and a critical mind to recognize that ``education'' vs.\ ``taxes'' are not \emph{real} policy alternatives, on which \emph{any} real political competition could, let alone \emph{should} be waged --- if only for the obvious point that public education \emph{requires} taxation.

%At the least, when all their sloganeering-gone-science is done, \cite{Abbe2003} should deconstruct the issues presented into the ideological alternatives that underly them:
%a belief that ``the economy'' is a more important issue than ``education'' \emph{does} embody an ideological --- if unsophisticated --- predisposition to place more emphasis on the market and material values, rather than typically public and emancipating education.
%Were \citeauthor{Abbe2003} honest, they would concede that even their data bears out this conclusion that \emph{really, issues are non-issues}:
%the conditional probability for a voter to vote republican with shared issue priorities (.17) is --- hardly coincidentally --- the same as the respective coefficient for republican ideology (.18) (\emph{ibid.}:
%425).

%The flawed reasoning on ``issue'' campaigns becomes apparent when you consider ``social security''.
%That a republican candidate is unable, as they show, to successfully campaign on this issue to voters who prioritize it, has obviously little to do with any sort of ``ownership'' of the issue:
%it is just that Republicans happen to be widely known to wish to \emph{cut} social security, an agenda that is unlikely to be popular with people who think of these government programs as important.
%In short, there \emph{is} no successful way for a Republican to campaign on social security, not because he lacks ownership, but because this \emph{issue} is in fact a \emph{preference}, and one that Republicans do not share.

%Latently affirmative of the changes they chronicle, \citeauthor{Abbe2003} should remake their work on issues into critical analyses of these foul tricks to remake the political and social world into a world of choices that really do not exist.

%Likewise, theoretically lightweight as their present work is, they should set out to explain how and under which circumstances campaigns are able to discursively establish these pseudo-choices and priorities, an attempt that will likely lead them to the more fruitful framework of Agenda Setting.

%\subsubsection{Innovations in Campaigning}

%\paragraph{Professional Campaigns}
%\cite{Gibson2001} provide a succinct analytical integration and party-centered explanation of the changing nature of political campaigning.
%Like others in the field, they see three stages in the development of political campaigns, with the recent transformation towards \emph{professional campaigns}, that are elsewhere referred to as \emph{post-modern} or \emph{Americanized} campaigns.
%These new campaigns share their use of modern information and communication technology (including automated analytics and messaging technologies), are generally expensive, continuous and neatly targeted in their efforts, with a strong national center\footnote{Local chapters are however able to carve out some degree of independence, and may launch their own professional campaigns, as \cite{Strachan} describes.}.

%In accordance with the framework suggested here, \cite{Farrell2000} describe professional campaigns as changing from catch-all to a market-segmentation approach and \citeauthor{Gibson2001} \citeyearpar[32]{Gibson2001} point out that:
%\begin{quote}\emph{Voters are seen more as consumers than loyal partisans, to be wooed with sophisticated advertising rather than serious political education.}
%\end{quote}

%Professional campaigns should not be thrown out like the proverbial baby with the bathwater.
%Their power to organize communication in large and functionally differentiated societies is  a blessing --- when put to use responsibly.
%Deploring mediatization, as some of \citeauthor{Strachan}'s (\citeyear[72]{Strachan}) protagonists do, is besides the point.
%In a modern, functionally differentiated society (``mass'' being a redundant qualifier), facing a multitude of complex public choices, some degree of specialization and mediatized communication is of the essence.

%And yet it also carries within it the organizational and technological seeds enabling a neo-Downsian race down to the lowest discursive denominator and is deeply embedded in this dynamic.

%\cite{Gibson2001} may understate and misconceive the role of parties in the emergence of professional campaigning, when they only point to increased education of the electorate, newly available communications technology and regulatory changes, tipped by recent electoral defeats and internal power struggles.
%Rather, it is suggested here, professional campaigns should be understood as (dominant) strategies adopted by parties, seeking to maximize their ballot bang for the campaigning buck, in a complex world of partly unsophisticated voters, who can no longer be activated or convinced on a single or simple preference dimension.

%When professional campaigning is in fact found to serve this purpose, we must turn our analytical attention to the \emph{interaction} and \emph{interdependence} of organizational and technological innovations and the degenerate political competition they serve to target, script and optimize.
%We must then describe and criticize professional campaigns as what they are:
%a dysfunction.

%\paragraph{Technology is Epiphenomenal}
%A prominent theme in the literature on professional campaigns is technological innovation, particularly web-based products and services.
%As awe-inspiring as these technologies are, they are, as such, as epiphenomenal as the shift from black-and-white to color TV.

%\cite{Gueorguieva2007} provides an instructive example of the dangers of a-theoretical technological determinism and hype.
%When she describes how a democratic campaigner was staffed to record public appearances of the republican opponent and upload borderline racist ``mishaps'' onto YouTube, with subsequent outrage and wide popularity, it is not clear at all what the substantive contribution of YouTube as a medium is.
%Clearly, any local cable station or even network, would have gladly accepted the same footage, and brought it to a wide audience by much of the same logic that said inflammatory material garnered popularity in YouTube.
%Genuinely excited, \citeauthor{Gueorguieva2007} really seems to believe that YouTube ``provides free and broad dissemination of campaign messages and ads, thus affecting the campaign budget'' and that ``its nearly 20 million unique visitors per month are also a considerable audience'' (293).
%She fails to note that visitors on YouTube --- which also is \emph{not}, as she claims, a \emph{social network} --- are not \emph{all} exposed to \emph{all} the footage uploaded, but that views are widely dispersed, and that six-digit views for any \emph{single} video are exceedingly rare and hard to achieve.
%The much more relevant dysfunction of campaigning based on verbal mishaps of one's opponent appears to be amiss to her.

%Much of the excitement and, more often than not, misconceived \emph{namedropping}, should be replaced by a theoretically integrated argument explaining \emph{why} and \emph{how} exactly this new technology matters.
%Surely, these technologies appear likely to allow for much greater individualization, targeting and new forms of interaction --- but a mere \emph{restating} of that question, with a few Web 2.0-references thrown in for good measure is not quite yet social \emph{science}.

%Following the framework suggested herein, technological innovations must be investigated in terms of them enabling parties to gather intelligence on, and compete on more preference dimensions and optimize their dominant strategy of ballot bang for the campaign buck.

%\paragraph{From the Evil Campaign Strategist's Cookbook}
%Clear and unabashed support for a neo-Downsian theory of dysfunctional political competition --- while unbeknownst to him --- comes from \cite{Malchow2003}, providing hands-on advice how to maximize your ballot bang for the campaign buck in his handbook on ``The New Political Targeting''.

%Right in line with the above model specification that parties care about the ballot bang/campaign buck ratio, he shamelessly admits that ``The task of the campaign strategist is to find the easiest path to victory'' (\emph{ibid.}:
%9) and advises to ``spend your money where you get the most value'' (\emph{ibid.}:
%256).

%He is also outspoken with regard to the dimensions and preferences that will work best:
%\begin{quote} \emph{Compared to gun control and abortion rights, the environment is a weakling of an issue.
%(\ldots).
%(There,) the devil is in the details and voters don't like details.} (\emph{ibid.}:
%201).
%\end{quote}
%He goes on to describe how powerfully and easily gun control can be employed to mobilize\footnote{He also notes how, in a uniquely perverse irony of history, increasing gun registration legislation has generated databases that allow pro-gun campaigners to target and mobilize their sympathizers effectively.}:
%\begin{quote} \emph{Gun control has been an important factor in deciding the outcome of many elections --- usually by defeating the pro-gun control candidate.
%While broad majorities in most states support gun control laws, those opposed to gun control are more energized and ready to vote for their guns.
%The ability of the National Rifle Association and other gun-owner organizations to find and mobilize
%their supporters has become a powerful force in politics and has given the gun lobby clout far in excess of its public support} (\emph{ibid.}:
%198).
%\end{quote}

%These cynical admissions of a campaign strategist corroborate the suggested neo-Downsian theory in a number of ways:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{Professional campaigns maximize vote share for the buck.}
%	\item{Professional campaigns choose and pick dimensions and positions on which to campaign strategically.}
%	\item{The cost function to mobilize or convince voters is independent of the overall, underlying preference distribution:
%in this case, the nutbar ``pickups and shotguns'' guys (an official type from Malchow's book, \emph{ibid.:
%10}) rule the day, not because they are many, but because they are easily committed.}
%	\item{Campaigns are willing and able to choose supposedly socially suboptimal positions (pro-gun), independent of the median voter's position (anti-gun), and on a dimension (gun control) arguably somewhat secondary in importance.}
%\end{enumerate}

%In a revealing choice of words, \cite{Malchow2003} also supports the supply-side view that this theory adopts, and casts into doubt any hopes for voter empowerment by dealignment and individualization when he describes his trade as one of ``harvesting voters'' (\emph{ibid.}:
%10).

%\subsection{There is no Conspiracy}
%Democratic governance has met its enemy:
%it is us, when we heed the temptations of strategic campaigning.
%And yet, even after peeking into \citeauthor{Malchow2003}'s cookbook, some cautionary notes against conspiracy theorizing are required.

%As \cite{Louw2005} reminds us in classic pluralist fashion, even insiders are no conspirators:
%they are many, they compete, and they are in factions.
%More often than not, attempts to seize power by discursive manipulation of the strategic kind fail.
%As \cite{Hall1980} has forcefully argued:
%encoding and decoding are complex processes, and they are imperfectly understood and anticipated by would-be manipulators.

%\subsection{Strategic Interaction under Agenda Setting}
%I will introduce one further complication to the above model by relating to the theory of Agenda Setting, a frequent topos in the campaigning literature, aptly summarized as `not telling you what to think, but what to think \emph{about}' \citep{McQuail-2000-aa}.

%To model agenda setting in the context of the theory suggested here, model specification four has to be altered:
%when agenda setting matters, parties \emph{cannot independently} choose dimensions to campaign on, they are instead limited in their choice by whomever moves first, or more effectively.
%In line with this specification, \cite{Farrell2002} note that there are ``conscious attempts to set the agenda and define the terms of public debate''.

%On the other hand, it appears unlikely to assume that the agenda setter can impose any issues or dimensions on other players.

%Agenda setting under a neo-Downsian theory of dysfunctional political competition then appears as a veto player problem \citep{Tsebelis-2002-aa}, where first movers or powerful agenda setters can exert undue influence on the consensually agreed-upon dimension(s) of campaigning by anticipating other players indifference curves, and pre-empting other players moves.

%A full adaptation and specification of Tsebelis is unfortunately beyond the scope of this piece, but will surely be a worthwhile endeavour.

%\section{The Only Fix:
%Deliberation on the Common Good}

%\subsection{Avenues and Imperatives for Further Research}

%\paragraph{Lots of Questions Asked} Surely, all of the above presented is but an hypothesis awaiting empirical tests, albeit a plausible one.
%Key empirical questions include:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{Does political sophistication vary with socio-economic status?}
%	\item{Do political parties choose campaign dimensions and positions based on costs of convincing and mobilizing, when other positions closer to the median voter are available?}
%	\item{Do qualitative interviews with campaign strategists corroborate the dynamics of political competition presented herein?}
%	\item{Are chosen campaign dimensions and positions systematically of subordinate importance, or tend to obscure redistributive issues?}
%\end{enumerate}

%\paragraph{No Benefit of the Doubt}And yet, when a dysfunctional political competition of the neo-Downsian kind can be made plausible, or even just from a cursory inspection of today's political debates:
%in a critical social science, there can be no \emph{benefit of the doubt} for professionalized, targeted and strategic campaigning.

%\paragraph{Theory, no Post-isms} The study of post-modern campaigns, as it is with all the \emph{post-isms}, must not settle for a vague sense of something being \emph{past}.
%Instead, it must explain what dynamic replaces the old one, and theorize the process of social change at work.

%This is not what \citeauthor{Abbe2003} do when they act as disinterested bookkeepers of a fundamentally dysfunctional political competition.
%This is not what \cite{McAllister2002} does when he lightheartedly reports on more ``calculating'' and ``capricious'' late deciders, ignoring entirely the question of whether these calculations make any sense.

%\paragraph{\href{http://maxheld.de/2009/10/13/setting-goalposts/}{Disinterested Just Doesn't Cut it Anymore}} The study of professional campaigning has to achieve more than a-theoretical, empiricist, uncritical and latently \emph{affirmative} accounts of the status quo.
%\cite{Farrell2002} miss an important point when they merely ask:
%``Do Political Campaigns Matter''?

%Instead, the question ought to be:
%what is the level of debate at which these stalemates are reached, issues are chosen and voters are targeted?
%Are we likely to see socially optimal and equitable policies emerge from this political competition?
%And if not, why not --- and what can be done about it?

%I must find out where they're going so I can lead them'}\\\\
%	Fictional pollster Joey Lucas on \emph{The West Wing}
%\end{quote}

%\paragraph{R.I.P., Pluralism} It would appear from this neo-Downsian theory of dysfunctional political communication that the pluralist idea of liberal democracy has failed, on empirical grounds:
%``there is no active citizenry'' (\citealt{Louw2005}:
%15).

%Or rather, I would add, there is no citizenry with sufficiently sophisticated political beliefs ex ante, and no political movement willing to do anything about it.
%Instead, professionalized, targeted campaigning allows parties to exploit this very inadequacy, and to put on a decent horse-race show, for good measure.
%Strategic campaigning and the race to the bottom it gives rise to are the last nails to pluralism's coffin.

%\paragraph{My Brother's Keeper / My Sister's Keeper}
%So, what to do?
%How to reform and reinvigorate political competition in a world to complex for any one citizen to master?

%To make that marketplace of ideas fair and real again, in hopes for socially optimal and equitable outcomes, we have to move toward deliberative democracy as best we can.

%A deliberative ideal of democracy does away with \emph{all} pre-socially formed beliefs and attitudes, and puts it all up for a fair, and common-spirited debate.
%It is not a totalitarian democracy of the Rousseauian kind --- it allows for, and encourages \emph{alternative} conceptions of the common good \citep{Elster-1998-aa, Cohen-1989-aa}.
%For it to work, the very opposite of pluralism, a sense of ``Justice as Fairness'', has to prevail, where only arguments are permissible that assume away knowledge of one's own position in society, under a veil of ignorance \citep{Rawls-1971}.

%And so, rather than speaking for yourself, a good argument will always speak to the common good, and remind us of that biblical command, to \emph{be our brothers' and sisters' keepers}, whatever their political sophistication and socio-economic status.

%\paragraph{Starting Here, Step by Step}
%So, how do we get there, to that mythical land of deliberative democracy, which, admittedly, exists largely in abstraction?

%Real reform starts in the here and now, and evolves towards that more perfect union from the status quo.

%For us, the status quo are mass political organizations, orchestrating mediated campaigns, waged on millions of often ill-prepared citizens.
%There is no near-term option to do overcome this functional differentiation, if there ever will be.
%And an unequally sophisticated electorate is here to stay, for our lifetimes at least.

%So we must pioneer an ugly hybrid:
%the \emph{deliberative campaign}, mediated and professional.
%We must resist the temptation to choose and pick the easiest way to a voter's cross, and instead be assiduous in our explaining, convincing, empowering and engaging ourselves, on to those \emph{real} public choices that we face.
%\emph{Those} public choices that are complex, even to the expert and seemingly inaccessible for the everyday voter.
%\emph{Those} public choices that matter so urgently, but the public choices, which, to translate into the experiences of everyday, and the opportunities of everyone, we must craft a whole new language.

%There remains hope that once given an honest chance, we, as voters will hear the difference in tone, and no longer fall for the dirty tricks.

%There remains the promise and the duty, that:

%different types of issues:
%For once, the issues that are represented in unconventional forms of participation are different from those of other modes.
%Typically, these organizations make protest demands, following a negative logic (“against”, “stop” …) and they maintain “at best rudimentary (…) platforms” (Offe 1985:
%829).
%Their claims are not part of an encompassing agenda, but are non-negotiable single issues.
%Consequently, unconventional modes of participation do not have to face trade-offs between goods, and are structurally incapable of bargaining, compromise and issue-linkages.
%While this is an effective strategy to mobilize people and to communicate concerns, it is an incentive structure that distorts the political competition at the expense of political parties, possibly contributing to their legitimacy deficit.
%Additionally it is a political logic that is not in line with the limitations to the input aspects of democratic governance as stated above.
% I therefore believe it may be a lot too simple to say that merely the repertoire of political participation is changing (Welzel 2002b).

%The deliberative argument, as young says is "reason over power".
%(Young 1996:
%122).
%Now if you drop reason, too, you're left with nothing.
%She points out that deliberation so competition.
%No, no no.
%It's persuasion, whicha lways entails understanding the other persons circumstance.
%I am not even talking about the baad essentializing (male speaking, female speaking)

%The CoelhoPozzono 2005:
%181 account of participation in local health administration is insightful when it comes to the boundaries of involving people:
%"The dendecy of citizen representatives to construct their arguments in a way that is regarded as unstructured, combined with their focus on highly localized issues, makes their speeches appear unclear, emotional, disruptive or irrelevant to most representatives of the other sectors.
%Moreover, this style of speech tends to be associtaed with poorer and less educated people, and it is regarded as not only ineffective, but also virtually unintelligble". -->

### The Good Old Days

<!-- %\paragraph{Dealignment}
%When \citet{Lazarsfeld1968} went out to Erie County, OH in 1940 to figure out ``How the Voter Makes up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign'' they found that citizens voted in relatively socio-economically homogenous groups, that socio-economic status neatly predicted their voting behavior.
%Also, people would typically vote as their parents had, and swing- or late-deciding voters where relatively scarce.

%This has since changed dramatically.
%Party alignment as weaked, arguably both as a corellate of a broader disaffection with (mass) associations \citep{Putnam-1995-aa} as well as as a function of an unfolding value space, whose multiple dimensions two (or even multi-) party systems can no longer accomodate \citep{InglehartWelzel-2005-aa}.

%\paragraph{Individualization, Targeting of Voters}
%The second, not entirely disjunct trend is one of individualization \citep{Beck-2002-aa}.
%The lifestyle choices of people diversify, and become (at least superficially) more independent from socio-economic status.

%This sociological trend is part and parcel with the emergence of new means of production, that allow for customization of products and services.

%Also, advances in information technology allow for an ever greater degree of automatic capture and intelligent analyses of these increasing differences between people.
%In the ream of political campaigning, this is happening in targeted political advertising.

%As \citet{Malchow2003} describes in his handbook of political campaigning, modern technologies in analysis (ranging from the mundane correlation and regression to cutting-edge neural network modeling or data-mining) and information-\emph{narrow}casting (for example:
%from ZIP-code cable TV to bloc-specific mailings, or household-specific phone banking) allow professional campaigners to act on the increasing differentiation of lifestyles.
%Specifically, Malchow advocates that professional campaigners use as much available (seemingly unrelated) lifestyle and otherwise information to concentrate their efforts on those voters they are most likely to activate (for GOTV efforts), convince (for swing voters) or persuade (for supporters of the opposing party).

%\paragraph{Political Campaigning under Dealignment, Individualization}
%What does money spent in campaigns have to do with all of this?
%Simple:
%the above trends of party dealignment and individualization, in the current configuration of political competition \footnote{More on the arguably dysfunctional dynamic of the current configuration of political competition in my other assignment}, require intensive professionalization of campaign efforts (otherwise referred to as ``Americanized'' or post-modern campaigns), which in turn, is costly.

%Once this dynamic is set in motion, as \citet{Gibson2001} argue, typically by electoral defeats, followed by changes in internal leadership and a consolidation of power at the center, other competing parties have to follow suit.
%\citet{Strachan} observes this dynamic even at the grassroots-level of local campaigns, where alternative, low-budget, face-to-face campaigning was the norm until recently:
%``Jack didn't want to do the kinds of things candidates have to do.
%It's commendable to run a race on \$50,000, but when the opponent has \$400,000 he sets the rules, and that's what happened in this race''  (\citealt[72]{Strachan}).

%Professionalization, and with that, increasing spending of political campaigns, then emerges as a dominant strategy, speaking in terms of game theory:
%no matter what the other party does, you're always better off professionalizing.
%And low-budget campaign ``collusion'', while potentially Pareto and socially optimal (as is arguably the case at the municipal level), becomes a Prisoner's Dilemma of cooperation.

%\section{How does increasing campaign spending affect the political process?
%--- \\The normative debate}

%\paragraph{The Facts:
%Money Doesn't Seem to Buy Elections}
%Conventional, if cynical, wisdom holds that with increasing spending, money can buy elections.
%Empirical findings supporting that claim, however, are scarce.
%In a cleverly designed study, comparing repeat contestants (thereby controlling for a large share of candidate-inherent qualities) in U.S.\ House elections, \emph{rogue economist} \citet{Levitt1994} found no significant effect of campaign spending on electoral outcomes, controlling for a large number of other factors\footnote{Levitt, concerned with social welfare, however, concludes from this finding, that some cap on campaign spending would be beneficial, as results are unlikely to change and wasteful, irrational extravagance could be avoided.}.

%An intuition along these lines, doubting the measurable effectiveness of one's campaign and spending was also offered by Frank Stauss of the Berlin-based Butter agency in class, reflecting on the impact of the 2009 SPD federal campaign.

%\paragraph{The Path-Dependency of Professional, Expensive Campaigns ---\\ Leading to \emph{Hyper-Majoritarian} Democracy?}
%A methodological note of caution should be in order here.
%Levitt's, as much of the other research on the impact of campaign spending (and its antecedent professionalization) was based on majoritarian systems \citep{Lijphart-1999-aa} of governance in the Anglo-American world.
%With their single-member plurality electoral system (``First Past the Post'', FPTP), and its correlate two-party system, it appears reasonable to assume that most electoral contests would feature only two (reasonably feasible) candidates, who will relatively easily achieve some degree of media and otherwise exposure in their districts.
%Under proportional representation electoral systems (PR), where more parties compete not just for plurality seats, but for percentages of the popular vote, ex-ante exposure of candidates may be much more unequally distributed, with many of them marginalized.

%As Levitt implicitly concedes in his paper, fundraising is likely subject to great path dependencies and economies of scale:
%it is disproportionately easier to raise funds for a successful, well-known candidate than for other, less well-known contestants.
%Even in systems where all, or more of campaign spending is publicly funded (as in many European systems), a similar dynamic is conceivable.
%Also there, public funds depend on past performance at the polls, and, if campaign spending is to feature curvilinear effects, path dependencies could be at work.

%Taken together, the possibility of hyper-majoritarian competition in both consensus as well as majoritarian democracies arises, where few candidates (or issues, or parties) stand a chance at gaining some popular support, given how high the ``market entry costs'' are.
%Granted, however, the recent German trend for large parties to loose shares seems not to support such a dynamic.

%\paragraph{The Ties That a \$1000 Breakfast Plate Binds \ldots}
%More questions towards the legitimacy of high campaign spending, and, related, private fundraising remain.
%Even if Levitt is right as it seems, and private campaign donations are unable to buy elections, it is conceivable that, given the Prisoner's Dilemma of high-spending, donors may be able to exert undue influence on or at the least, access to office-holders.

%\section{Conclusion}

%I first conclude that private campaign donations should be outlawed, if only for the reason of \emph{suspected} undue influence.
%In all of the below, I refer to a scenario of high, but entirely publicly funded campaign expenditure.

%\paragraph{Campaign Spending and Trends in Representative Democracy:\\ Yes, It Is Inevitable}
%I conclude from the above, and the potential Prisoner's Dilemma-type competition between parties, as well as the broader trends of dealignment and individualization, to which professional, expensive campaigns respond, that indeed, higher campaign spendings are an inevitable outcome for all representative democracies.

%\paragraph{Campaign Spending and Voter Apathy}
%Going back to the aforementioned background trends and correllates of high campaign spending, party dealignment, and individualized targeting, given persistent if not increasing voter apathy I wonder whether really, the link with high campaign spending is a causal one.

%It could well be argued that voter apathy, possibly caused by dealignment and a misconfiguration of the political competition, is the independent variable to which frantic individualization and expensive professionalization of campaigns are merely dependent responses.

%But more importantly, I wonder whether increased campaign spending is not completely epiphenomenal to the potentially misaligned political competition, and related voter apathy.
%At least at the federal or state level, it appears inevitable that cheap, unmediated, face-to-face campaigning for representative democracy, is no option.
%As simple and reliable class voting patterns dealign and dissolve, previously instrumental to mass mobilization, more (financial) effort to communicate competing ideas is clearly necessary.

%Much rather, it seems possible that the slicing and dicing of the electorate into neatly defined groups, some (or many) responding strongly to their own (if relatively irrelevant or ill-defined) ``hot-button issues'' will lead to a political competition at the lowest, dysfunctional denominator.
%I try to explore how such a dynamic could work in the other assignment.

%I would then conclude that high campaign spending is not as such the problem for voter engagement, at least if realistic opportunities for entry are available to new contestants or ideas.
%With a publicly funded, regressive schedule of campaign finance (relatively less money for successful parties in the past, a sort of party ``infant-industry'' protection), and political competition about the \emph{true} alternatives (not ``issues'') of public policy, effectively communicated and exchanged, expensive campaigns should be considered a wise investment, not a frivolous extravagance.


%The crisis is not one of overload, that i expect Crozier, Huntington and Watanuki (1975) as cited in Warren 2003, but one of underresourcing.
%And in these questions you always have to think about the ideal, utopian hypothetical, which, sadly, we hardly ever do. -->

<!-- ## The Detective Story of Income Taxation (Who Dunnit? Who killed progressivity?)

> "The real and pressingly practical question for tax is not whether to have an income or a consumption tax, but what form of consumption tax to have. The stakes in this battle are clear and dramatic: the fate of progressivity in tax lies in the balance."
> Edward J. McCaffery (2005: 817)

> "Advocates of redistributive taxes must wake up and realize that their end is in jeopardy on account of their poor choice of means: they are fighting, and losing, the wrong war."
> Edward J. McCaffery (2005: 848)

The political alternatives now seem to be between progressive income tax and prepaid proportional/flat consumption tax (VAT, Social Contributions, Payroll, all equivalent). This is an incomplete choice set.
The one progressive component of today's tax regimes, the personal income tax, has deficient backstops.
- Estate and gift taxes (buy, borrow, die)
- Corporate income tax (indeterminate incidence, no progression, indeterminate location of value generation)

The personal income tax as structural flaws, remaking the PIT ever more into a wage or prepaid consumption tax.
1. Macomber. Tax on accession/accrual or tax on realization? The Supreme Court rules: you can tax only on realization (selling).
 this problem is much exacerbated in the case of income in illiquid assets.
2. Tax Planning 101 aka Buy, Borrow, Die. Mrs Macomber could simply borrow on her (appreciating!) stock as collateral. Recall that borrowing, is not income under an income tax. Mrs Macomber can spend out of the borrowing tax-free.
3. Heirs never pay the estate tax, because that is (as it makes sense) a net tax on assets minus liabilities. In the extreme case of Tax Planning 101, there is no estate.
4. Also, Tax Planning 101 incentivizes people to never realize, to never sell. This may lead to markets freezing up and asset as well as derivatives (!) bubbles, at great cost to the economy. -->


## A Vicious Cycle

These two crises --- an ineffective and/or inefficient welfare state and a confused democracy --- may partly reinforce one another into one perfect storm of societal reaction by stealth:

> The two issues, the crisis of egalitarian politics and the trivialization of democracy, are not necessarily the same.
> Egalitarians might say that they do not care how manipulative of democracy a government is, provided it divides society's wealth and power more evenly.
> A conservative democrat will point out that improving the quality of political debate need not necessarily result in more redistributive policies.
> But at certain crucial points, the two issues do intersect [\ldots].
> My central contentions are that while the forms of democracy remain fully in place --- and today in some respects are actually strengthened --- politics and governments are increasingly slipping back into the control of privileged elites in the manner characteristic of pre-democratic times;
> and that one major consequence of this process is the growing impotence of egalitarian causes.
> --- Colin @Crouch2004 [6]

<!-- %So \emph{really}, is all ``for [\ldots] the best [\ldots] in the best of all possible, [liberal-democratic, capitalist] worlds''  (\emph{ibid.}: K428ff).
%
%Today, Dr.~Pangloss, the 18th century teacher, might feel vindicated in this Leibnizian \citeyearpar{Leibniz1710} optimism.
%Since industrialization set on in his age, the developed economies have grown annually by initially 1.3\%, then 3.1\% in GDP per capita (\citealt{Easterlin2000}: 10f), prospering as no human society ever has \citep{DeLong1998}.
%Since enlightenment dawned at his time, the established democracies have fostered peaceful mass participation and liberal democracy continues to proliferate \citep{Huntington-1991-aa}.
%
%But Candide, Voltaire's hapless title character and Pangloss' na\"{i}ve student, might still stumble into misfortune, and despair over the hardship of (some) contemporary lives.
%In the richest of countries, he might be dismayed by growing poverty (for example, \citealt{Bundesregierung2006} for Germany, widening inequalities of wealth and income (for example, \citealt{Grabka2007a}: 138 for Germany, \citealt{Bucks2006} for the US), crumbling public services and state budgets in crisis or default.
%In the richest of times, he might be troubled by the dark shadows of global warming (for example, \citealt{Stern-2006-aa}), aging populations (for example, \citealt{Demeny-2003-aa}: 2, \citealt{Borsch-Supan2000}) and stalled productivity %add source
%looming over our long-term prosperity.
%\marginpar{Include other, OECD-wide sources.} In the oldest of republics, he might be repelled by distorted debates and decision-making deadlocked %add source,
%and in the finest of democracies, he might be frustrated by ill-informed \citep{Delli-CarpiniKeeter-1996-aa}, ignorant, %add citation
%irrational \citep{Caplan2007} and dissatisfied voters \citep{PutnamPharr-2000-aa}.
%
%Candide's puzzled lament, in the novella as in the real world, does not lead anywhere.
%He does not specify what would mark a better world, does not consider what limits may govern the real world, and suggests no path to progress.
%Such discontent without alternative is impotent.
%
%But Pangloss' unwavering affirmation of the status quo does not lead us anywhere either.
%He, the (satirized) learned scholar, does not so much``admirably prove[\ldots] that there is no effect without a cause'' (\citealt{Voltaire1759}: K36) but mindlessly naturalizes the existing state of affairs.
%He disavows alternative or even better worlds and thereby fails to explain the cause for their non-effect and betrays the humanist calling of science.
%Such analysis without alternative is fallacious and amoral. -->

<!-- %if you'd want to hide injustice, you'd best do it in a really complex system, like tax. -->

<!-- % offe:

<!-- i don't even mention the issues of imperfect economic integration here (EU!), though much of them can be read as extensions of the malaise described here -->

<!-- first, you have to show here that tax is a worthwhile issue; it *is* the social contract, and it is currently in bad shape, and it *is* the best way to address a lot of our problems (not spending, not printing money, no nothing) -->

<!-- also, crucially, the point here is *not* how inequality is positively (that is pretty complicated), nor how how the contravening institutions should be calibrated.
The point is that, *no matter* the desired redistribution, the institutions are bad. -->

<!-- this is also, when talking about mixed economy, strictly about institutions which *reconcile* command and market economy (otherwise, somewhat misleadingly, called democracy and capitalism)
it is at this interface that this diss is, and the question is whether the institutions governing this interface are good or bad, whether they can somehow satisfy the demands of *both* an efficient market economy, and a democratically powerful sovereign
the question, emphatically, is not about *where to steer*, so to speak.
but just what kind of steering mechanism we should have
the engineering metaphor doesn't fully work of course, because, as it turns out, it's not a well-defined engineering problem that you can outsource to experts (maybe not even in engineering, who knows)
there are *already* deep, last-reason kind of question *in* the design questions for the steering mechanism, so to speak
that is what this is about
some people criticise this as "market-compatible democracy", but that's misleading.
neither mechanism is somehow inherently superior, or more legitimate.
or at least there is no reason to assume this here. -->

<!-- it's easy to see how accounts of material inequality (or lack thereof) become marred in ontological and axiological fights, and burrow down to last reasons -- though *these* are emphatically *not* the last reasons that are of interest here.

<!-- also, this kinda feels like the "good old days", as if things were much better earlier.
that's not really the point
this is not primarily, an account of how things have gotten worse *empirically*: in part, that becomes pretty hard, because so many other things change (multicollinearity)
there may not be much to be gained here, or, in any case, that's not what I offer here.
Instead, across tax, welfare state and democracy, I point out *a priori* inconsistencies in the ideal-typical versions of these institutions, as they were instituted in the past.
This need not imply that the past was actually all that great.
It's really just a pragmatic way of going about this: one might also call this a tale of three not-quite-great systems, but that just doesn't have the same ring to it.
nothing wrong with urgency
but be careful here, I don't actually have a posteriori (empirical) account.
more crucially, this being a priori stuff, it also *needs* no such account; pointing to the contradictions suffices.
this is just politicisation, in a way.
WHY this chapter?
because it points to the importance, and takes the first step to the last reasons, to the deep disagreements undergirding this all.
politicisation is, broadly speaking, necessary for any deliberation.
you need some kind of a question.
if this were in fact all completely "normal", and just the way things are, then there's no need.
so going back to the ideal-typical formulation of these institutions, no matter how much they were ever attained in the real world, is an exercise in policisiation.
The empirical record, is only used to cursorily *illustrate* these claims. -->

## The Mixed Economy
<!-- (this is our beef, not welfare state) -->

Welfare states are governed by the economic abstractions arising from the co-existence of market and command.

When you organize production and distribution of goods and services by market *and* by command, as welfare states do, the two contradictory systems "complexly interact" [@Perrow-1999-aa] and easily produce "unintended consequences" [@Merton-1936-aa] as for example, when ().

To this day, the *mixed economy* of Postwar Western Europe, in its idealized form, is the closest thing to an angel to ever emerge from this uneasy coexistence between market and plan.
To understand first-order desiderata of welfare state design, we need to understand the conceptual compromise of the mixed economy.
Let me first reiterate the logic of its two constituent systems.

#### Market vs. Planned Economy.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:market-vs-command\]]{#sec:market-vs-command label="sec:market-vs-command"}

We can organize economic production and distribution in at least one of two ways,

by centralized, coercive command or

by decentralized, voluntary exchange.
[^1]

1.  In an ideal-typical [@Weber-1920-aa] *command economy*, whoever wields an effective monopoly on the use of force also directs the economy.
    A worker constructs, say, a railroad (production) and is fed by a farmer (distribution), both in fear of --- however indirect --- bodily harm from the monopolist of violence.
    [^2]

2.  In an ideal-typical *market economy*,
    [^3]
    violence is threatened only to maintain property rights and enforce contracts.
    People freely exchange goods and services at equilibrium prices that balance the costs to the producer and the utility to the consumer (, p. ).
    A worker constructs a railroad (labor) in return for an enforceable promise to consume (property) a given amount (wage), which he then redeems in a similar exchange with a farmer for food.

#### Capitalist Welfare State is a Pleonasm.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:interface\]]{#sec:interface label="sec:interface"}
Welfare states combine elements of command and market in the service of *equity*.
[^4]
Specifically, welfare states coercively adjust the *distributional* outcomes of markets.
[^5]
[^6]

Welfare states insure their citizens against certain individual risks (disability, sickness, unemployment), fight "poverty" by instituting (unconditional or means-tested) minimal living standards and, sometimes, reduce inequality by compressing the income and wealth distribution of the citizenry.

To reach each of these goals, welfare states have to intervene in voluntary exchanges between buyers and sellers.
For better and/or for worse, welfare states change market equilibria.
No matter the legal structure, welfare state institutions never exist *outside* the market:
even "nationalized"
[^7]
health care needs to buy doctors (at what salary?) and drugs (at what price?) on free markets.
No matter the labeling, welfare state institutions never exist *independently* of the market:
even social "insurance".
[^8]
alters labor market outcomes (who should, and can bear the burden?).

Welfare state institutions can interact with markets in more or less attractive ways:
they can have a smaller or larger [dwls]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="plural+short"} (, p. ), and they can have well or ill-defined incidences (, p. ), but they always interact.

Welfare state institutions can expand (UK socialized health care) or contract (Germany social health insurance) the scope of its command, but they will always interface with the market at some frontier between the two systems, as illustrated in (p. ).
This interface is ill-defined, as two incompatible logics collide, twice:

1.  The state demand curve (dashed in green) for doctors or hospitals breaks down, as the marginal utility of an additional doctors to citizens (the ultimate consumers) cannot be known.
    [^9]
    The state therefore has to determine the citizenry demand, usually based on a [cba]{acronym-label="cba" acronym-form="singular+short"} or a related procedure --- all of which are really nothing but fancy names for sophisticated economic planning.

2.  The state cannot *command* the required supply (of doctors or hospitals), but must instead *buy* the supply from state revenues on free markets.
    [^10]
    Again, the logic of the market breaks down:
    the state as the only buyer (of doctors or hospitals) creates a monopsony, causing distributive effects (to the disadvantage of doctors or hospitals) and welfare losses (a [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"}).
    Alternatively --- maybe more plausibly --- the producers of medical care may capture the planning body and extract rents, distributing away from the public and also causing a welfare loss.
    Either way, pricing poses unavoidable problems:
    somewhere down the line, producers require a price, but without atomistic demand, no pareto-optimizing price can be found.
    This is not to say that if health care --- or some other welfare service --- *were* completely privatized, such pareto-optimal equilibrium *would* be reached.
    In fact, government procurement of health and other services can be understood as a response to *for* these goods (p. ).
    Arguably, government procurement replaces one (horrendous) market failure with another, (milder) form of failure.

<!-- TODO img here The Command-Market Interface in UK and German Healthcare -->

\scriptsize{
    Market supply and demand are drawn in a conventional price-quantity diagram.
    For a larger version, see \autoref{fig:supply-demand} (p.~\pageref{fig:supply-demand}).
    I discuss the \hyperref[sec:market-solutions-production]{competitive market equilibrium} later (p.~\pageref{sec:market-solutions-production}).}
I aim here to distill for welfare, what Edward @McCaffery2002 urges us to do about tax:
"to find an angel or two in the abstractions that govern \[...\]" [-@McCaffery2002 K117].

I look for these angels in an *ideal* closed, mixed economy.
The account I provide in the (p. ) -- ) does not resemble any *real* existing economy, where abstractions are often shrouded in historical idiosyncrasies, and angels rarely found amidst imperfect policies.
But this is a question of the (p. ), and to know what is materially doable and normatively desirable we need (p. ), not a posteriori reality.

Even without the details, the abstractions alone need considerable space to be explained.
I urge readers to take the time, even if much will seem familiar and some things appear remote to welfare, let alone taxation or democracy.
They are not:
from (p. ) to network effects (p. ), (p. ).
Missing any one of these abstractions, we cannot know what welfare and taxation can, and should do.

Four disclaimers apply to my tentative answer on this very big question:[\[sec:disclaimers\]]{#sec:disclaimers label="sec:disclaimers"}

1.  [\[itm:not-original\]]{#itm:not-original label="itm:not-original"} *Not Original*.
    The perspective I take here is hardly original.
    Many others have, in greater width [@Stiglitz2002] or depth [@Sinn2004], with narrower [@Scharpf1997] or different foci [@Zurn-2000-aa] discussed the first-order shortcomings of "negative" integration (in the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}:
    @Scharpf1997), and economic liberalization everywhere [@Stiglitz2002], and have, in that context, defined the conditions of a mixed economy.

    I aim here to review the works of others and to restate some fairly conventional economic concepts in order to build a first-order checklist of welfare state design.

2.  [\[itm:no-test\]]{#itm:no-test label="itm:no-test"} *No Positive Test*.
    I cannot myself muster the methodological rigor or provide the econometric data, to test the first-order theories of welfare state design, but rely on mainstream literature instead.

    The economics of the welfare state are vastly complex, incompletely understood and any policy initiative requires careful (empirical) investigation to balance the often contradictory imperatives of economic policy.

    Moreover, as I later find for taxation, reforms of the magnitude implied herein may strain against the current limits of economic science:
    experimental designs lack in external validity of a vastly complex modern economy and simulations often lack the data, or even computing power to model such inframarginal changes.

3.  [\[itm:no-calibration\]]{#itm:no-calibration label="itm:no-calibration"} *No Calibration*.
    I offer no calibration of the mixed economy and its institutions, and, for the purpose of this chapter, advocate no *particular* balance between market and state, efficiency and equity or any of the other trade-offs a mixed economy may face.
    Instead, I highlight the capacities and dysfunctions of markets and *potentially* able to mitigate these shortcomings (p. ).
    I consider under (p.  ) and hypothesize how they might explain the (, p. ).

4.  [\[itm:little-macroeconomics\]]{#itm:little-macroeconomics label="itm:little-macroeconomics"} *Little Macroeconomics.*
    I limit this discussion to very basic concepts of the real economy, and ignore many of the more complex models, especially of finance and money.
    Modern macroeconomics, including such powerful frameworks as the IS/LM model are important [originally @Hicks1937], but would go beyond the already lengthy treatment here.

    I also suspect and hope that macroeconomics is best investigated by experts and its policy imperatives safely implemented by technocrats.
    Monetary policy, for instance, may not raise deep normative questions or offer vexing trade-offs in need of democratic adjudication:
    its imperatives hinge on contested and imperfect, but merely first-order, positive findings on a mass psychology of price and cost signals (see , p. ).
    To a lesser extent, finance, too, may be politically epiphenomenal:
    money and other property rights move in tandem *with*, and are *secondary* to material economic exchanges in the ideal mixed economy (see p. ).
    To the extent that polities can agree on specific and measurable objectives (such as price stability, or risk diversification), macroeconomic policy really can be delegated to independent central banks or other regulatory bodies.

    By limiting the discussion to a few rudimentary, but deeply understood concepts of the real economy, I also hope to reconnect regional integration and the welfare state to an *econonomic imagination* [paraphrasing @Mills-1959-aa] of our material affairs as a household --- only with a cast of billions.
    [^11]

    Inevitably, much of the detail and complexity that policy makers have to consider, will fall by the wayside.

    If the defining characteristic of a welfare state is its uneasy union of market and plan, we must first understand the broader interplay of exchange and command in the mixed economy.
    (p. ) summarizes exchange (or market) and command (or state) institutions to address five material dimensions of the human condition:
    (p. ), (p. ), (p. ), (p. ) and (p. ).
    This is a slightly expanded set, inspired by @MusgThet1959's [-@MusgThet1959] seminal definition of basic public policy functions:
    allocation/efficiency, distribution and stabilization (for example, as cited in [@Bordo2011 4].
    It also corresponds to @Samuelson-1954-eu's authoritative textbook [recently -@Samuelson2005] desiderata of a mixed economy:

    1.  to let scarce resources be efficiently allocated by *competitive markets*,

    2.  to improve the equity of market outcomes through *redistribution*,

    3.  to provide *public goods* by government procurement and

    4.  to limit inherent market instability by financial regulation and well-directed monetary and fiscal policies

As stands, the game appears stacked against the market, as there is no list of government failures.
In fact, failures abound in the command economy:
without credible information about individual utility [confer @Hayek1931], and an elegant mechanism for their aggregation [confer @Lerner1944; @Lange1934; @Debreu1954] resources are easily wasted and misallocated and even command components in market economies are prone to *government failure* [@Coase1964].
Moreover, a market economy seems to be closely related to liberal democracy,
[^17]
and bloated command economies may corrupt politics,
[^18]
or even threaten the very constitution of freedom [@Hayek1944; @Friedman1962].

Here again --- to "economize on moral disagreement" [@GutmannThompson-2004-aa K226] and to lend credence to my later conclusions --- I conservatively place the burden of proof on the state:
production and distribution by markets should *only* be replaced or altered by command when the market can demonstrably not achieve the desired outcomes, that is, when problems materialize (row 4 in ).

I now discuss the five material dimensions of human need in turn.

## Taxation and Welfare

Why does taxation matter for human welfare?

As @Schumpeter knew, "in the modern world, taxation *is* the social contract" [@Martin2009a, 1, emphasis in original], even though social scientists have since paid little attention to it [@Tilly2009, K191].
Tax matters especially for current OECD-style welfare regimes, in which markets and states must co-exist [@Stiglitz2011].
In such a mixed economy, government must be able to draft some privately-owned resources to serve its --- ideally democratic --- *command*, without unduly altering the prices of --- ideally competitive --- *exchanges* [@Ardant1975, 165f].
<!-- TODO ref chapter on mixed econ here -->
Much of modern social integration occurs in the balance of these two contrasting logics to produce and allocate resources, "enmesh[ing] us in the web of generalized reciprocity that constitutes modern society" [@Martin2009a, 3].
State plans make the conditions *for*, and set limits *to* *individual* action, as when government builds roads or collects sewage fees.
Conversely, market exchanges produce much of the "fungible resources" used for *collective* choice, as when government pays road builders or procures sewage pipes [@Martin2009a, 4].

Of all conceivable institutions to govern the interface of states and markets, taxation --- not price controls, not expropriation, not debt, not printing money, not tariffs --- is the most equitable, efficient and sustainable [@MusgThet1959; @Stiglitz2011].
<!-- TODO ref tax-matters chapter -->
Welfare states, with their penchant for market interventions for equity, efficiency *and* sustainability, especially, rely on good taxes.

<!-- %bad überleitung, the instead doesnt work -->
Still, taxation everywhere in the OECD is in crisis.
As alternative sources of economic relief --- monetary expansion and sovereign debt --- are maxed out, structural misalignments persist, and previously forestalling (asset) bubbles have burst into their days of reckoning, public revenues appear to be strictly limited by the longtime coming contradictions of current tax regimes [@Streeck2013].
<!-- %not sure about this soure, must read it -->
The popular mixture of (progressive) income, (proportional) consumption and (regressive) payroll taxes appears to offer only harshly unattractive tradeoffs between equity and efficiency [@McCafferyHines2010], as bases have shrunk and schedules flattened [@Ganghof2006].
At the same time --- possibly partly as a result --- inequalities of incomes and wealth have widened [@Butterwegge; @Wagner2007; @Grabka2007].[^no_wealth_distro]
<!-- TODO mention here that inequality findings are contentious -->

[^no_wealth_distro]: Data on the distribution of wealth is conspicuously hard to come by [@Crouch2004, 158] or ordinally summarized in deciles, rendering much of the inequality invisible.

If governments cannot raise the resources necessary to meet democratic demands without incurring prohibitive costs, the social contract is fraying [@Crouch2004].
<!-- %so so shource -->
Whichever way governments now turn, absent better tax, they will violate the post-war capitalist compact of stable, widely shared growth [@Pierson2002; @StreeckMertens2010].

[\[sec:market-solutions-production\]]{#sec:market-solutions-production label="sec:market-solutions-production"}
Assuming, as I do, (p. ) and conditions for (p. ) markets have at least two attractive properties:
[^20]

1.  when all participants have made all profitable exchanges,
    [^21]
    markets produce at the quantity and price where the costs to the producers equal the willingness to pay of buyers (see , p. ).
    Consumers and producers in any given market enjoy maximum *surplusses*:
    all consumers pay prices (at least incrementally) below the utility they receive (by area $A$), all producers receive prices (at least incrementally) above the costs they incur (by area $F$).
    In this *competitive equilibrium* (see column 1, row 4 in , p. ), no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off:
    it is *Pareto optimal*.

2.  The *price system* (see column 1, row 4 in , p. ) makes markets into supreme "information processors" [@Hayek1931].
    [^24]
    Because decisions are decentralized, markets can elegantly aggregate dispersed information where a central planner would have to gather them by bureaucratic means (such as a [cba]{acronym-label="cba" acronym-form="singular+short"}).
    Because market decisions are always backed by private costs, the market price system can reveal and communicate (some!) private information, where a central planner may face distorted (inflated) information about cost and utility.

    ##### Conditions for Perfect Competition. {#sec:perfect-competition}

    The above properties of market equilibria hold only under the strict assumptions of perfect or atomistic competition.
    In one formulation, this entails [@McDowell2006 157f.]:

    1.  *Infinite buyers and sellers*.
        [\[itm:infinite-buyers-sellers\]]{#itm:infinite-buyers-sellers label="itm:infinite-buyers-sellers"}
        There are so many consumers and producers in the market that an offer or bid by any one of them will have a negligible impact on prices.
        Everyone is a price taker.

    2.  *Zero barriers to entry and exit*.
        [\[itm:easy-entry-exit\]]{#itm:easy-entry-exit label="itm:easy-entry-exit"}
        Firms can start or cease to produce a good at relatively little cost and effort.
        All markets are wide open.

    3.  *Perfect factor mobility.*
        [\[itm:perfect-factor-mobility\]]{#itm:perfect-factor-mobility label="itm:perfect-factor-mobility"}
        In the long run, labor, capital and other inputs to production can move to wherever they earn the highest rents.
        It is hire and fire.

    4.  *Perfect information*.
        [\[itm:perfect-information\]]{#itm:perfect-information label="itm:perfect-information"}
        Consumers know all prices and qualities of goods, producers know all prices and qualities of factor inputs.
        People are omniscient and powerful calculators of utility.

    5.  *Profit-maximizing firms*.
        [\[itm:profit-maximizing-firms\]]{#itm:profit-maximizing-firms label="itm:profit-maximizing-firms"}
        Firms sell at the price and quantity that maximizes their profit.
        [^25]
        Other, exogenous criteria are not part of firm decision making.
        Given the other assumptions of perfect competition, firms sell where marginal cost equals marginal revenue.
        [^26]

    6.  *Homogeneous products.*
        [\[itm:homogeneous-products\]]{#itm:homogeneous-products label="itm:homogeneous-products"}
        Goods produced by one supplier are the same as those produced by another supplier of the same category.
        Inputs provided by one factor owner are the same as those provided by another owner of the same factor.
        All goods and factor inputs are completely commodified.

    To this, one might add, according to @Wikipedia2012:

    7.  *Zero transaction costs.*
        [\[itm:zero-transaction-costs\]]{#itm:zero-transaction-costs label="itm:zero-transaction-costs"}
        Buyers and sellers can exchange goods, services and make contracts at zero cost.
        Search, information, bargaining, policing and enforcement costs are assumed away.
        There is no friction.

    8.  *Constant returns to scale.*
        [\[itm:constant-returns-to-scale\]]{#itm:constant-returns-to-scale label="itm:constant-returns-to-scale"}
        For any additional unit produced, costs rise by the same amount, no matter how much units are produced.
        The cost function is *linear*, marginal costs are constant.
        There are no (dis)economies of scale or scope.
        [^27]

        Constant returns to scale are related to, but distinct from assumption [\[itm:easy-entry-exit\]](#itm:easy-entry-exit){reference-type="ref" reference="itm:easy-entry-exit"} on .
        Excessive economies of scale imply difficult entry.
        Conversely, difficult entry implies varying marginal costs at low output.

    9.  *Property rights*
        [\[itm:property-rights\]]{#itm:property-rights label="itm:property-rights"}
        are well established.

    Lastly, --- if somewhat redundant, because axiomatically assumed away by neoclassical welfare economics --- I would add:

    10. *Utility equals willingness to pay.*
        [\[itm:same-budgets\]]{#itm:same-budgets label="itm:same-budgets"}
        The first theorem of welfare economics --- that above specified perfect markets equilibrate at pareto optimality over *initial* distributions --- is often misrepresented to imply that individual *utility* is adequately expressed in willingness to pay, on which free market exchanges operate.
        This shortcut works only under the most heroic assumption of all:
        that all market participants have the same budget constraint.

        If everyone invoking the first theorem were to represent it in full, including the crucial, qualifying "...over *given* allocations", this condition for perfect competition would be unnecessary.
        Alas, many do not.

        Moreover, equating individual utility with willingness to pay constitutes what might be called the of welfare economics (p. , because it *both* assumes equal *and* unequal budget constraints:
        the former to maximize utility, and the latter as incentive.
        For a thesis so thoroughly grounded in neoclassical orthodoxy as this, it seems appropriate to feature this contradiction prominently.

    I note wherever I relax some of these strict (and rarely plausible) assumptions in the following sections (summarized in , p. ).

    It should be clear then that I make the above, conservative or neoclassical assumptions less out of conviction, but for their logical elegance and to "economize on moral disagreement", as [@GutmannThompson-2004-aa K226] have suggested.
    I hope these positions will be widely acceptable to readers on the political right, and provisionally tolerable to readers on the left.
    If I can show taxation to be wasteful, unfair and unsustainable and democracy to be outmatched, assuming even such liberal orthodoxy, sweeping reform should be all the more obvious.

#### Market Failures.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:market-failures\]]{#sec:market-failures label="sec:market-failures"}
Markets operate efficiently on private goods:
people can be *excluded* from their *rival* use (see ).
In this case, social costs and utility match private cost and utility.

From some goods, people cannot be effectively excluded and/or are not rivals in their consumption.
[^28]

In these cases, social and private costs and utility diverge and markets may fail.
Goods are overproduced when social cost is higher than private cost (*negative externality*), and goods are underproduced when social benefit is higher than private benefit (*positive externality*).
This problem holds more broadly for *public goods*, *common goods* and *natural monopolies* (see column 1, row 5 in ),
[^29]
summarized in according to @Samuelson-1954-eu's typology of goods [-@Samuelson-1954-eu].

##### Failure: Public Goods

\phantomsection
[\[sec:public-good\]]{#sec:public-good label="sec:public-good"}
are *underprovided* by markets, because no one can be prevented from using them (non-exclusion), and they do not get used up (non-rivalry).
Potential buyers can always free-ride on other's purchase and are therefore unwilling to pay producers adequately.
Defense is a public good and fireworks are canonical examples of public goods.

##### Failure: Common Goods

\phantomsection
[\[sec:common-good\]]{#sec:common-good label="sec:common-good"}
are *overused* on markets, because they are rival but again, no one can be prevented from using them [@Hardin-1968-aa].
Potential buyers can free-ride without paying the adequate price for exploiting the rival commons [@Hardin-1968-aa].
[^30]
[^31]
Clean air is a common good, and so may be the enlightened understanding of the electorate [@Caplan2007].

##### Failure: Natural Monopolies

\phantomsection
[\[sec:natural-monopoly\]]{#sec:natural-monopoly label="sec:natural-monopoly"}
arise where economies of scale abound in the production or distribution of goods or services, such that only a single or very few suppliers can profitably exist.
Natural monopolies are *mispriced at the margin* because after initial fixed costs --- which few single consumers would be willing or able to pay --- marginal cost become negligible.

Excessive economies of scale often occur in businesses dominated by fixed, rather than variable cost.
Sewer systems, electricity grids or search engines can be natural monopolies with prohibitively high entry costs
[^32]
for basic infrastructure (sewers, electricity masts, web indices) and later, negligibly small marginal costs for adding an additional consumer.
Natural monopolies can incur welfare losses in two ways:

1.  If only one market supplier exists, it may charge monopoly prices causing a deadweight loss of underconsumption.

2.  In the extreme, given the high marginal cost for the first buyer, no first buyer may come forth and the otherwise
    [^33]
    pareto-improving natural monopoly may not be provided at all.

##### Failure: Principal-Agent Problems.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:principal-agent-problem\]]{#sec:principal-agent-problem label="sec:principal-agent-problem"}
Principal-agent problems are one market failure of the broader class of information asymmetry problems (row 5, column 2 in , p. ), where at least one party to a trade knows less about the service, good or risk being exchanged (pioneered by Nobel laureates @Akerlof-1970-aa, Stiglitz [-@Stiglitz1976] and @Spence1974).

In principal-agent problems, the asymmetrically known quality is the effort exerted by the agent on behalf of the principal.
When agent (say, manager) effort cannot be fully observed by principals (say, owners), and principals have interests (say, long-term returns) diverging from those of agents (say, a pet project), agents may be able to cheat on their contracts.
When agents shirk successfully, they will exert less (or ill-directed) effort than would be pareto-optimal.
In the extreme, the market between principals and agents breaks down completely, as principals anticipate shirking agents and forego the transaction altogether.

Applied game theory and related disciplines offer a host of incentive designs to realign interests of principals and agents, which I need not discuss here comprehensively (but see @Tirole2006).
Solutions include (p. ) --- which creates unemployment --- or deferred compensation and tournaments --- which invites risk-seeking (Holt 1995).
Efficiency wages and tournaments try to alter the probabilistic calculus of would-be shirkers by promising outsized instead of *marginal* rewards and punishment for whichever effort *is* (randomly) observed.
Deferring (part of) the compensation to later may make agents more far-sighted, but will still strictly cap their downside risk, especially when only bonuses are deferred (for example, stock options).
The worst that can happen to an agent in any of these schemes is to loose their job, the tournament promotion or their bonus.
By contrast, the worst that can happen to a principal, is to lose everything.

In addition, if the observations of effort on which such schemes are based are spotty or isolated --- as they often are --- agents can "game the system" and incentives may turn ineffective, or even perverse.

Both (p. ) and tournament compensation also increase economic inequality:
instead of marginal productivity, they reward (p. ) and threaten losers with unemployment.

All these incentive design schemes fall short of the one genuine solution to realign principal and agent interests:
to either sell agents stock or charge them a substantial sign-up fee [@Tirole2006], effectively making agents into principals, too.
Only then can they bear both the full upside and downside risk of the enterprise.
To be able to take on such risk, of course, agents must own substantial assets, which they may not have in an unequal economy.

Principal-agent problems fail markets if, and to the extent that, inequality in assets prevents people from taking equal risks in otherwise welfare-enhancing joint projects.
They are one of the cases, where inequity makes for inefficiency, too.

This is not merely a theoretical conumdrum, but a very real problem for postindustrial and knowledge-based economies (for example, Lisbon Strategy, EU 2020, @Bell-1973-aa).
[^34]
Almost by definition, an economy based on knowledge and innovation will display information asymmetries.
The effort a knowledge worker (say, a programmer) puts in, cannot easily be observed, because that would require the principal to acquire the exact same specialized knowledge (say, a programming language).
Similarly, a would-be innovator (say, an [ict]{acronym-label="ict" acronym-form="singular+short"} entrepreneur) will always know more about her nascent and uncertain innovation than any possible investor, because otherwise, the investor would have done the project herself, already.

In short, for competitive markets to do their magical "stochastic tinkering" [@Taleb2007 211], people need to be equipped and incentivized to act on their local and uncertain ideas, and to specialize.
For a *homo economicus* at least, there can be no *entrepreneurship* without some *ownership*, too.

#### State Responses to Market Failures

\phantomsection
[\[sec:state-responses\]]{#sec:state-responses label="sec:state-responses"}
States can respond to market failures by fiscal and regulatory interventions.
I discuss them for each type of good (rows 6--8, column 1 in ).

##### Fixing Public Goods.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:public-good-response\]]{#sec:public-good-response label="sec:public-good-response"}
States can step in to *provide public goods* or subsidize their private provision, both out of the public purse (fiscal policy).
There is no regulatory or monetary response to public goods failure.
[^35]

##### Fixing Common Goods.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:common-good-response\]]{#sec:common-good-response label="sec:common-good-response"}
States can protect overused commons by a regulatory policy of "fencing in the commons".
[^36]
By doing so, governments follow the [@Coase1960] theorem.
It holds that markets can pareto-optimally resolve externalities if transaction costs are sufficiently low, and if property rights are well-defined.
[^37]
The Coase theorem is often erroneously cited to argue against state intervention.
Maintaining and *issuing new property rights* are, of course, *regulatory* state interventions.
[^38]

Alternatively, states can resolve "Tragedies of the Commons" [@Hardin-1968-aa] fiscally by slapping a *Pigouvian tax* (@Pigou1912, popularized by @Baumol1972) on using the commons.
[^39]
The Pigouvian tax prices in the externality of using a common good.
[^40]

There is no monetary response to overused commons (see , p. ).

<!-- %here are two important notes from prospect theory, and Kahnemann 2012
	%I think insurance requires only the weaker (contested by Kahnemann) expected utility hypothesis (bernoulli), who says that risk aversion can be explained merely by diminishing marginal utility (specifically, argues Bernoulli, utility is a logarithmic function of wealth).
%Maybe I can do here with risk aversion and don't need LOSS aversion (based on reference points), which is what Kahnemann is out to explain, and with him prospect theory.
%Consider a weird graph about that in Kahnemann.

	% Kahnemann raises a big stink with indifference curves:
%he says neoclassical economics is wrong there, because prospect theory shows that people have reference points from which they are loss averse, suggesting that there is no such thing as an indifference curve (I am not sure that is formally right, the indifference curve just wouldn't be linear, as it might be).

<!-- %\subparagraph{Fixing PCA-Problems}
%\subparagraph{Entrepreneurship Needs Broad-Based Ownership.} \phantomsection \label{sec:Ownership} More deductively, market economies can be thought of as welfare-maximizing because they capture decentralized and/or privately known information, and let diverse solutions compete.
%Nassim Nicholas \cite{Taleb2007} has put this succinctly by praising ``aggressive trial and error'' (\emph{ibid.}:
%xxi) in free markets that ``allow people to be lucky'' (\emph{ibid.}:
%xxi)\footnote{Being a quantitative trader by profession, \cite{Taleb2007} actually abandons rational choice when faulting Karl \cite{Marx-1867-aa} and Adam \cite{Smith-1776-lq} for believing that free markets work because of rewards.}.
%This basic impetus for capitalist creativity is expressed in desideratum \ref{des:Entrepreneurship}:

%\begin{desideratum}[Entrepreneurship]
%	A desirable tax will allow entrepreneurs to make their own production decisions according to their independent judgement of private and/or local information.
%	\label{des:Entrepreneurship}
%\end{desideratum}




%But what is required for this ``stochastic tinkering'' (\citealt{Taleb2007}:
%211) to work?

%Principal-agent theory suggests that maximum effort may not be exercised when effort of agents is imperfectly or non-observable, or other information asymmetries prevail.
%This of course --- unobservable effort and information asymmetries --- are likely features of highly differentiated knowledge economies\footnote{Calls for more startups, patents and research spin-offs, particularly in Germany, may serve as evidence for suboptimal incentive design under the status quo.}, where people produce an idea, not a piece of welded metal (cf.~\citealt{Bell-1973-aa}).
%Game theoretic incentive design suggests that information asymmetry problems can be resolved either by making agents shareholders or by charging them substantial sign-up fees, both of which require substantial assets to begin with \citep{Tirole2006}.

%In short, for competitive markets to work their magic, people need to be equipped and incentivized to act on their local and diverse ideas.
%For \emph{homo economicus}, there can be no \hyperref[des:Entrepreneurship]{entrepreneurship} without some \hyperref[des:BroadOwnership]{ownership}, too.

%This ties in with the simple capitalism desideratum presented earlier, but it also adds a specification:

%\begin{desideratum}[Broad-Based Ownership]
%	A desirable tax allows for or promotes a broad-based ownership of the means of production.

%The burden of proof is on the state for interventions in the market.

%Taxes and other state interventions in the economy can in fact enhance market outcomes in several ways:

%this figure is obsolete, it is now \label{tab:ends-mixed-economy}

%\begin{description}
%	\item[Redistribution.] \phantomsection \label{sec:fiscal-redistribution} Governments may respond to excessive \emph{inequality} by taxing people proportionally or progressively to redistribute resources.
%While inequality is further discussed in \autoref{sec:tax-justice} on \hyperref[sec:tax-justice]{equity}, it does bear on efficiency, too, as is argued in \autoref{sec:InequalityIsInefficient}.

%	\item[Risk Pooling.] \phantomsection \label{sec:state-insurance} People can possess \emph{asymmetric information} about things of uncertain quality they exchange on the marketplace.
%Insurance of unemployment, health or disability are principal examples, where sellers of risk (insurants) typically know more about their own risks than buyers of risk (insurers)\footnote{This relaxes perfect competition condition {itm:PerfectInformation} (\hyperref[itm:PerfectInformation]{perfect information}).}.
%Less-informed buyers (insurers) of risks may expect bad risks for \emph{all} insurants, causing premiums to rise and driving low-risk sellers out of the market entirely.
%This mechanism may repeat until no exchanges are made at all, defeating the purpose of insurance.

%	Governments can avoid these \emph{lemons markets} by forcing everyone to take out insurance \citep{Akerlof-1970-aa}.
%When risks are universal --- as is arguably the case for unemployment, health and disability --- the premiums for these insurances are effectively taxes.

%	\item[Public Goods] \phantomsection \label{sec:public-good} can be enjoyed by an arbitrary number of people without exhaustion (non-rivalrous) and no one can be excluded (non-excludable) from its using (\citealt{Samuelson-1954-eu}, summarized in \autoref{tab:Types-Of-Goods}).
%National defense is one example.
%Because people in larger groups can always free-ride on the provision of public goods by others, they are likely to be \emph{underprovided} by self-seeking individuals or markets \citep{Olson-1971-aa}.

%	Governments can improve welfare by providing public goods out of tax revenue.

	%the types of good table happens earlier, as 	\label{tab:types-of-goods}

%	\item[Common Goods] \phantomsection \label{sec:common-good}  are rival in their consumption but do not allow exclusion:

%A \emph{Tragedy of the Commons} occurs when people overuse the common good \citep{Hardin-1968-aa}\footnote{Elinor \cite{Ostrom1990} criticizes the canonically assumed failure of commons in social science and provides an empirically grounded account of their successful, non-coercive governing.}.

<!-- Some theories for self-reinforcing inequality
%\paragraph{Path Dependence or Cumulative Causation.} The third dynamic of \emph{path-dependent or cumulative causation} refers to situations where small initial state differences in performance lead  to additional opportunities, reinforcing initial inequality.
%These additional, scarce opportunities may be awarded to individuals (or firms, or regions) based on easy but imperfect measures (think SAT scores).
%They may also be awarded based on probabilistic predictions on future performance (think past scholarships), further increasing a self-reinforcing dynamic.
%In the worst, most inequitable (and inefficient case), they are awarded based on meaningless, randomly occurring differences (think mental state on day of testing), haphazard selections (think first come, first serve) or systematic measurement bias (think habitus expectations by assessors).

%Malcolm \cite{Gladwell} illustrates this dynamic in his account of \emph{Outlier} hockey stars in Canada, whose birthdays are significantly more often in the early months of the year.
%\citeauthor{Gladwell} attributes this to very early elite selection in Canadian hockey and a cut-off point between the different leagues on each December 31st, giving children hockey players born early in the year a slight developmental advantages over their peers, amplified by the additional training they receive if initially selected.

%Path-dependent or cumulative causation of inequality are frequently observed in educational systems, particularly in those which track students early (as in Germany).

%These dynamics also apply elsewhere, where initially only slight differences lead to divergent experiences, reinforcing inequality and leading to further opportunities, for example when individuals or firms benefit from learning curves or economies of scale after initial jobs.

%\paragraph{Self-reinforcing Network Effects in Scale-Free Distributions.} The fourth dynamic are self-reinforcing network effects in homopholous networks with a scale-free graph distribution.
%Networks are formalized as \emph{graphs} comprising of \emph{nodes} (individuals, firms) interconnected with (directed, undirected and/or weighted) \emph{edges} (aquaintance, contracts) \citep{Kleinberg-2009-oz}.
%The \emph{degree} of a node is given by the number of edges emerging from it.

%I will first illustrate the graph theory of innovation diffusion \citep{Bass1969} with a simple example, the diffusion of fax machines.
%Assume that individuals (nodes) decide on whether to purchase a fax machine based on the technology's inherent value (the \emph{innovation coefficient}) and the value they realize from the number of their peers (degree) also owning a fax machine (the \emph{imitation coefficient}).
%Consider first what would happen in a grid network, where every individual is connected to each adjacent individual (all nodes have the same degree).
%Assume next that initial adopters are randomly distributed.
%Fax machines would, largely determined by their inherent value, proliferate (or not) relatively homogenously over the entire network.
%It will be unlikely that any given individual (node) has many more peers with fax machines than any other individual, rendering the imitation coefficient relatively inconsequential.

##### Fixing Natural Monopolies.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:natural-monopoly-response\]]{#sec:natural-monopoly-response label="sec:natural-monopoly-response"}
Governments can avoid the deadweight losses of natural monopolies fiscally, by nationalizing them (for example, public ownership of motorways in Germany) and ideally charging users a fee at *average* cost (for example, trucks and coaches on federal motorways in Germany).
[^41]
Governments can also procure natural monopoly goods and services from private firms and charge users a fee at average cost (for example, local railway in Germany).

Alternatively, governments can allow privately held natural monopolies but tightly regulate them to enforce pricing at average cost and avoid a monopoly [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} (for example, *last mile* [ict]{acronym-label="ict" acronym-form="singular+short"} or electricity in Germany).

There is no monetary response to natural monopoly problems (see footnote [\[fn:monetary-commons\]](#fn:monetary-commons){reference-type="ref" reference="fn:monetary-commons"}).

#### Monetary Policy for Price Stability.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:price-stability\]]{#sec:price-stability label="sec:price-stability"}
Monetary policy contributes best to efficient production --- and almost all other dimensions of material human need --- by staying out of the way of markets with stable prices to allow efficient exchanges in the first place.
[^42]
[^43]
When prices rise (inflation) or fall (deflation) overall, otherwise pareto-optimal exchanges may be hampered.

The welfare losses of inflation include

hoarding (of real assets),

drowning out relative price changes (noise),

increasing transaction costs (such as shoeleather costs
[^44]
and menu costs

[^45]
), as well as

general uncertainty and possibly, unrest.

Cost-wage spirals
[^46]
make inflation self-reinforcing, potentially escalating into hyperinflation.
Inflation is also believed to set off the business cycle [@Friedman1970].

Deflation, while scarcely observed in the western world in the post-Bretton-Woods regime,
[^47]
is similarly damaging.
It also makes

transactions more costly and

heightens uncertainty.

Deflation can also

cause the hoarding of cash and

trap liquidity
[^48]
and self-reinforce into a deflationary spiral.

In the long run, monetary expansion (or contraction) should follow the output of the economy $G$, so that price levels stay stable.
[^49]

Whether inflation and deflation are, as the monetarists would have it, "always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" [@Friedman1970]
and therefore caused by an over-expansion or contraction of the money supply in the first place, or whether it has it roots in the real economy as the Keynesians would argue, is a very complicated empirical question but --- luckily for the author --- irrelevant to the state job of ensuring an efficient market place.
No matter "who dunnit", monetary policy should aim at price stability, and, perhaps, counteract real price shocks --- if and to the extent that they occur --- with (p. .).

Pooled Risks: Saving the Pie {#sec:risk}
----------------------------

[^50]

#### The Human Condition of Risk.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:human-nature-of-risk\]]{#sec:human-nature-of-risk label="sec:human-nature-of-risk"} Humans inhabit a volatile environment, marred by low probability, but high impact events (*black swans*, according to @Taleb2007), for example a serious work accident.
Unfortunately, humans also tend to ignore precisely such low probability, but high impact events [@Taleb2007], and overestimate the probabilities of favorable outcomes [@Baron2000 44], especially when they have few cognitive resources available.
When they give it some thought, most people *avoid grave downside risks*:
for example, most will prefer the certain but low cost of car liability insurance over the rare but high cost of paying for a car accident (column 2, rows 1--3 in ).
[^51]

#### Market Solutions to Risk: Insurance.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:insurance\]]{#sec:insurance label="sec:insurance"}
Markets provide *insurance* as a ready-made institution to address this human need for down-side risk aversion (column 2, row 4).
Insurants can buy protection from their grave downside risk, say, a car crash, by pooling their individual risks.
An insurance deal stipulates that all insurants will regularly chip in a small amount to cover the few unlucky car wreckers, in return for the promise that they, too, will receive a payout if they crash their cars.
[^52]

Aside from car insurance, markets do sometimes, to some extent, provide insurance against the four big life risks commonly associated with the welfare state:

unemployment,

sickness,

accident and

disability.
[^53]

Market insurance of these life risks *does not* involve a redistributive component, though that is easily assumed for unemployment insurance.
The *voluntary* exchange of premiums for coverage, in car and all other insurance, is a pareto-improvement:
all risk-averse insurants are better off, by hedging against downside risks.
Insurance is not obligatory and whoever finds it unnecessary (as may be the case for rich individuals who face limited downside risks) is not affected.

#### Market Failure in Insurance: Asymmetric Information. {#sec:asymmetric-information}

Insurance markets may fail when buyers and sellers possess asymmetric information about the risks to be insured.
[^54]

##### Ex ante,

\phantomsection
[\[sec:adverse-selection\]]{#sec:adverse-selection label="sec:adverse-selection"}
insurants with privately known high risk may disproportionately take out insurance.
Insurers, anticipating such *adverse selection*, but unable to tell high-risk ("lemons") from low-risk ("cherries") applicants,
[^55]
may expect bad risks for *all* buyers, causing premiums to rise and further driving low-risk insurants out of the market.
This *lemons market* mechanism may repeat until no exchanges are made at all, defeating the purpose of insurance [@Akerlof-1970-aa].

Adverse selection abounds in the insurance of the big life risks.
Ex ante, insurants know more about their likelihood to become unemployed, sick, to be in an accident or become disabled than their insurers.
[^56]

##### Ex post,

\phantomsection
[\[sec:moral-hazard\]]{#sec:moral-hazard label="sec:moral-hazard"}
sellers of risk (insurants) might take on more risk than they otherwise would have, causing moral hazard and in turn drive up premiums.

Moral hazard, too, may occur in the insurance of big life risks.
Ex post, insurants may be willing to live less healthily, or more recklessly than they would without insurance.

#### State Responses to Asymmetric Information in Insurance.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:state-insurance\]]{#sec:state-insurance label="sec:state-insurance"}

##### Ex ante,

states can resolve lemons markets by *regulatory* means if they force everyone at risk to take out insurance (@Akerlof-1970-aa, @Barr)
(column 2, row 8).
[^57]

States can also resolve lemons markets by *providing benefits* out of the treasury (column 2, row 9).
As the risks of unemployment, health, accident and disability are near-universal,
[^58]
the contributions for such state-run insurance are effectively taxes.
Some states (such as Germany) outsource insurance to quasi-fiscal organizations.
This "social insurance" may make a difference in administrative, legal or rhetorical terms, but its economics are that of a state-run insurance and its revenues are taxes.
Financing public insurance out of dedicated "social contributions" (usually regressive payroll taxes) instead of general revenue only adds a specific distributive component (a regressive tax on labor) to the overall tax schedule.
[^59]
[^60]

Mandating insurance or, equivalently, providing benefits out of the public purse need not redistribute resources over and above the Kaldor-Hicks improvement from resolving a lemons markets.
Properly understood, state interventions to hedge *individual* risks are meant to improve the efficiency, not equity of outcomes.
Real policy often differs from this (p. ) and layers distributive components on top of the Kaldor-Hicks improvement.
In Germany, for instance, social contributions are proportional, but capped and public health insurance covers an insurant's children at no additional cost.
These additions to schedule and benefits may or may not be desirable, but they properly belong in the realm of (p. ).

##### Ex post,

states and markets have essentially the same, clumsy method to reduce moral hazard:
[^61]
they re-individualize some of the risk by asking for co-payments or provide incentives for prudent behavior.
Exploiting moral hazard is a (p. ), and can therefore be resolved either by (partial) property rights (co-payments) or by Pigouvian taxation (incentives).

Equitable Distribution: Slicing the Pie Fairly {#sec:distribution}
----------------------------------------------

#### The Human Condition of Inequality

\phantomsection
[\[sec:human-nature-of-inequality\]]{#sec:human-nature-of-inequality label="sec:human-nature-of-inequality"}
Humans, the social animals, can deal with material scarcity in two ways [@Pickett-2009-kx]:

"because members of the same species have the same needs as each other, they have the potential to be each other's worst rival" [-@Pickett-2009-kx 197] but also,

"the potential to be each other's best source of cooperation, learning, love and assistance of every kind" [-@Pickett-2009-kx 198].

Dominance Strategies.

:   The first, @Hobbes-1651-aaian [-@Hobbes-1651-aa]
    strategy is one of dominance:
    *homo homini lupus est*, man is a wolf to his fellow man.
    [^62]
    Following *dominance strategies* (column 3, row 1 in ), humans --- much like their primate cousins, the chimps --- maximize their classical evolutionary fitness (@Darwin1859, recently @Dawkins1976) by relying on individual power to secure access to scarce resources (food, shelter, females).

Affiliative Strategies.

:   The second strategy is one of *affiliation* (column 3, row 3) and mutuality:
    to be your "brothers keeper" ([kjv]{acronym-label="kjv" acronym-form="singular+short"} Bible, Genesis 4:9).
    [^63]
    Following affiliative strategies, humans ---as their other primate cousins, the bonobos --- maximize inclusive fitness (@Hamilton1964, popularized in @Wilson1975), or fitness emerging at the group-level [@Wilson2012] by cooperation, trust and reciprocal altruism [-@Pickett-2009-kx 202ff].

*Dominance hierarchies* (column 3, row 2) arise as dominance strategies prevail and (usually male) members of a species fight for higher status to successfully monopolize resources.
All but the highest status individuals are held to suffer from such heightened *relative* inequality (*ibid.*).

Instinct does not determine us to follow dominance strategies (as the chimps, according to *ibid.*) or affiliative strategies (as the bonobos, according to *ibid.*), and so we need culture and institutions to strike that balance.
*Both* markets and states can strike that balance, and reign in on dominance hierarchies.

#### Market Equity

\phantomsection
[\[sec:market-equity\]]{#sec:market-equity label="sec:market-equity"}
On competitive markets, people enter into voluntary exchanges that, at least, make everyone better off (if not necessarily by the same amount).
[^64]
Interactions under dominance hierarchies are *no such* pareto improvements;
the (physically) stronger will extract from the weaker all she can, possibly short of killing the weaker party if prolonged extraction is in the interest of the stronger party.
[^65]

*Real* existing market economies have sometimes --- but not always --- created sharp inequality.
Still, against the backdrop of dominance hierarchies, *ideal* market economies with , institutionalizing pareto-improving, voluntary exchange must be considered a civilizing achievement.
[^66]

#### Excessive Inequality

\phantomsection
[\[sec:inequality-dynamics\]]{#sec:inequality-dynamics label="sec:inequality-dynamics"}
Real existing, imperfect, modern markets display some excessively inequitable dynamics that may compromise this ability to at least somewhat compress dominance hierarchies.
In the following, I discuss some of these dynamics and further relax some assumptions of (p. ).

##### Efficiency Wages.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:efficiency-wages\]]{#sec:efficiency-wages label="sec:efficiency-wages"}
Efficiency wages are, counterintuitively, wages *above* the market-clearing rate.
At efficiency level, wages are so high, that some people cannot find gainful employment and must remain unemployed.
[^67]

Wages may be above market clearing rate because employers want to attract more applicants to choose from, because local traditions demand it, or even to feed malnourished workers.
Two other suggested reasons stand out:

1.  *Reducing turnover.*
    Employers may pay above-clearing wages because they want to avoid costly turnover.
    When faced with both potential unemployment, attractive, and, especially, seniority-graded wages, workers may not look for a job elsewhere (for example, @Salop1979, on [ldcs]{acronym-label="ldc" acronym-form="plural+short"} @Stiglitz1974a).

2.  *Avoiding shirking.*
    Employers may also pay above-clearing wages because they want to deter incompletely contracted and incompletely observed workers from shirking.
    Because employers (principals) can observe effort only sporadically and imperfectly, they will catch shirking workers (agents) only some of the time.
    Would-be shirkers face some probability of getting caught, a reward for continued shirking, and a punishment for getting caught and may optimize their behavior accordingly.
    Efficiency wages can thereby solve this (p. ):
    by increasing both wage and unemployment rate, employers widen the spread between the two probabilistic outcomes for would-be shirkers (getting caught, not getting caught).
    Risk-averse employees may then work hard to avoid the inflated downside risk of unemployment and loss of a generous wage [@Stiglitz1984].

Both when they increase wages to reduce turnover, and to avoid shirking, employers move the labor market out of equilibrium.
Otherwise pareto-improving employment is lost, and economic welfare foregone.
Still, efficiency wages may persist, because they are efficient --- individually utility optimizing --- for employers, if inefficient for the economy as a whole.
Employers enjoy lower turnover and shirking, at some price of higher wages, but they also push some of the social cost of above-clearing wages to everyone else.
If and to the extent that principal-agent problems are otherwise unavoidable, its socially costly remedy may not be considered a market failure:
there may be no way to make anyone better off (the unemployed) without making someone else worse off (well-paid employed and satisfied employers).

But even if efficiency wages were to destroy no welfare, they certainly redistribute it.
Here again, as in (p. ) or (p. ), people will be rewarded and punished *probabilistically* (not deterministically) and *out of proportion* to the marginal contributions they made --- or could make --- to the market economy.

##### Winner-Take-All.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:winner-take-all\]]{#sec:winner-take-all label="sec:winner-take-all"}
Five paradigms and stylized dynamics of today's economy point to the possibility of runaway social inequalities that may result in distributions much akin to dominance hierarchies, where whoever is at the top reaps most or all of the benefits [@Frank1996].

1.  \phantomsection
    [\[itm:non-linear-returns\]]{#itm:non-linear-returns label="itm:non-linear-returns"}
    *Non-linear returns to scale* in indivisible human capital may disproportionately reward highly-skilled workers, as demand for their skills increases in the knowledge economy and they cannot be replaced by several less-skilled workers.
    [^68]
    [^69]
    Similarly, some highly-skilled work can easily by scaled up (an algorithm can easily be deployed millions of time), but many other occupations cannot be easily scaled as production reaches a physical limit (a hairdresser can only do so many haircuts a day) (originally @Rosen1981, recently @Taleb2007).
    Given the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}'s proclaimed goal to become the leading knowledge economy in the world, it is to be expected that non-linear returns to scale in indivisible human capital will further increase [@Commission2007].

    *Baumol's cost disease* is a related, but inverse concept.
    According to [@Baumol1965], some sectors (such as manufacturing) enjoy faster productivity growth than others (such as nursing), but, competing for the same laborers, both sectors must raise salaries.
    In violation of (neo)classical dictum, the wages of, for example, nurses rise, even though they have --- supposedly --- not concomitantly gained in productivity.
    Much of these sectoral productivity gains are reflected in similarly increasing non-linear returns to scale in human capital:
    as the indivisible innovations (say, laser welding) of engineers are easily scaled up in manufacturing, such innovations are absent in nursing and would resist scaling.
    If labor is, as [@Baumol1965] assume, in fact, (p. ) workers will be free to choose jobs with above-linear returns to scale until pay equilibrates at the same level across scalable and non-scalable work.
    In this scenario, diverging productivities are priced into *sectoral costs*, not *worker pay*.
    As a flip-side to diverging pay from above-linear returns, unscalable sectors will either disappear or become *relatively more* expensive to *consumers* (as seems to be the case with nursing).
    is, of course, an implausible assumption.
    If workers cannot, in fact, freely choose to work in scalable (computer engineer) or unscalable occupations (hair stylist), those in unscalable occupations will bear the brunt of diverging productivities in lower relative pay.

    The truth, as often, will lie somewhere in between, and greatly depend on circumstance.
    Some of the divergence between scalable and unscalable occupations will fall on workers, some on consumers and much will be split.
    [^70]

2.  [\[sec:cumulative-causation\]]{#sec:cumulative-causation label="sec:cumulative-causation"}
    *Path-dependent rewards and cumulative causation* may also let winners take all or most.
    If small initial state differences in performance lead to additional opportunities, initial inequality will be reinforced (@Jackson1968 [@Merton1988] recently popularized by @Gladwell).
    [^71]
    This pattern of path-dependent or cumulative causation is often observed in educational systems, particularly in those which track students early (as in Germany) or where social permeability is low (as in much of Europe) [@OECD2006].

3.  [\[sec:network-effects\]]{#sec:network-effects label="sec:network-effects"} *Self-reinforcing network effects*
    occur where economic activity occurs along homopholous networks with a scale-free graph distribution (for an introduction to graph theory, see @Kleinberg-2009-oz).
    [^72]

    As actors (nodes) opt to interact with similar people (homopholy, for example, @Mcpherson2001), and opportunity (innovation) spreads (cascades) only among tightly nit groups (clusters) [@Bass1969] resulting utility (degree) distributions will be decidedly non-normal (scale-free, or fractal [@Mandelbrot2004]).

    Whenever features of economic consequence
    [^73]
    permeate through these networks of tightly clustered, self-similar nodes, opportunities and rewards will be a function of that same power-law distribution.

    Inequality, by the very structure of modern society, will be excessive and self-reinforcing [@Cozzi2009; @Keller2005; @Andriani2007].

    A similar dynamic, applied to economic activity in space, is implied in the agglomeration and scale effects of (p. ).

##### Different Budget Constraints.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:different-budget-constraints\]]{#sec:different-budget-constraints label="sec:different-budget-constraints"}
The magic of the (p. ) works over *given* allocations.
In the real world, wealth and income disparities cause market participants to have different budget constraints.
A higher budget constraint will inflate their willingness to pay and a lower budget constraint will deflate their willingness to pay, both at constant levels of utility.

As distributions in the real world are not a blank, egalitarian slate, the demand and supply curves are distorted by differential budget constraints.
Voluntary exchange no longer necessarily equilibrates at the pareto-optimum of *utility*, but at the pareto-optimum of *willingness*, and thereby *ability to pay*, a very imperfect and distorted proxy.

If anything, this glossed-over difference between absolute *utility* and budget-dependent *willingness to pay* is the original, logical sin of neoclassical welfare economics.

On the one hand, different budget constraints distort prices without any informational gain for @Hayek1931's superior information processing system:
budget-distorted willingnesses to pay are *misinformation*.
The old computer science adage applies here, too:
*garbage in*, *garbage out* (GIGO).
A market that equilibrates at multi-million yachts for people with outsized budgets and at malnutrition for others with very small budgets may, be formally pareto-optimal, but it may --- among other things --- not be utility-efficient in any meaningful way.
[^74]

On the other hand, such distortions of individual utility are precisely the sticks and carrots that incentivize homo economicus in market economies.
Market economies reward individuals by letting them amplify their utility signals with a larger budget constraint and they punish individuals by forcing them to subdue their signals with a smaller budget constraint.
These informationally useless spillovers from one exchange (Steve Job's inventions) to other, unrelated exchanges (Steve Job's consumption of yachts) are not merely a side-effect of market economies, they are their motivational essence.

As original sins go, they can never be redeemed in full --- at least not in this world.
So it is with the dirty little secret of neoclassical welfare economics:
to equalize all budgets at all times would be to abandon a market economy to the fullest.

Still, neoclassical economists and everyone else who relies on the first theorem must at least repent this sin by always confessing to it, and by highlighting its normative and policy implications.
Else may not await purgatory, but lies ideology.
We must not seal off, but open up an intellectual edifice to its criticism, we must not assume away but render transparent its inherent contradictions.

##### Diminishing Marginal Utility.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:diminishing-marginal-utility\]]{#sec:diminishing-marginal-utility label="sec:diminishing-marginal-utility"}
With each additional unit of goods and that people gain, the added utility may fall (theoretically by @Lerner1944 [23], recent empirical support from @Ng-1997-aa [@Veenhoven-2000-aa; @Nickell2008]).
Highly inequitable market outcomes will still be formally pareto optimal,
[^75]
but may leave great Kaldor-Hicks improvements unrealized as the poor stand to gain greater marginal utility than the rich would have to give up at their higher levels of consumption.
In short utilitarian slogan, given diminishing marginal utility, perfect markets do *not* yield "the greatest good for the greatest many" [@Mill1863].

##### Positional Externality.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:positional-race\]]{#sec:positional-race label="sec:positional-race"}
Thorstein [@Veblen1899] has suggested that people consume excessively not merely to fulfill some manifest function inherent to the good purchased, but that they buy expensive things to "heighten or reaffirm social status" [@Merton-1968-aa 123].
Veblen goods are bought not *in spite of*, but *because* of their price, which is ideally publicly known and serves to communicate wealth and status to others.

People consume conspicuously based on a *relational* rationale:
what matters is what *other* people think about the cost (or sophistication) of a Veblen good.
If people consume conspicuously --- at least partly --- to display status, the rationale is also *relative*:
what matters is how much you spend in relation to what other people spend.

Conspicuous consumption can then --- at least partly --- be understood as *positional* consumption:
people can elevate their relative status if, and to the extent that they spend *more* than their peers.
For this positional motivation for consumption, only *relative* prices (and qualities) matter, not absolute cost or utility.

Positional consumption can be modeled as a [pd]{acronym-label="pd" acronym-form="singular+short"}, as in .

: Positional Consumption as a Prisoner's Dilemma[]{label="tab:pd-positional"}

\scriptsize{The Joneses and the Does are peers, positional consumers and in the market for a new car.
Payoffs are the net of cost of car ($VW=0$, $BMW=-5$) and status gain from driving the \emph{relatively} more expensive car ($+10$ for superior, $-10$ for inferior, else $0$).
Larger payoffs are better.\\
    Prices of the BMWs are inflated so as to include the societal costs of wasteful consumption, here, as in an ideal world, accruing only to the buyer.}
In a [pd]{acronym-label="pd" acronym-form="singular+short"} of positional consumption, *more* excess will always be a strictly dominant strategy, and the unique Nash equilibrium.
The social welfare optimum of mutual moderation will not be reached.
People would derive same utility at collectively lower levels of consumption, but cannot do so for fear and anticipation of other players cheating by unilaterally consuming more.
[^77]

Consumers of Veblen goods may get stuck in a [pd]{acronym-label="pd" acronym-form="singular+short"}, racing to keep up with others [@Frank1987].
Positional consumption wastes resources because it imparts no additional utility and exerts a negative externality on others by devaluing their purchases (a process known as *expenditure cascades* *ibid.*).

##### Monopsony Employers.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:monopsony-employers\]]{#sec:monopsony-employers label="sec:monopsony-employers"}
When few, big firms face many, unorganized workers, labor markets may turn monopsonistic and cause both a welfare and a distributive effect.
[^78]

Welfare

:   is lost as some workers, facing lower wages stay home, who might otherwise have been gainfully employed at a higher, but still profitable wage.
    Under this monopsony [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"}, some otherwise pareto-improving exchanges are not undertaken.

Redistribution

:   .
    Further, compared to a competitive labor market, economic surplus is redistributed from workers to employers.

This power imbalance between labor and capital is arguably one of the deepest contradictions that capitalism created.

The free market, universalizing the commodity form, treats capital and labor as equal factors of production.
Capital and labor, are fundamentally *not* equal factors of production and have vastly different bargaining power for at least three reasons:

1.  Historically --- and to date --- capital tends to be *concentrated*:
    few have capital.
    By contrast, labor was historically, and is to date, greatly dispersed:
    many are workers.
    Larger groups with widely dispersed interests are harder to organize [@Olson-1971-aa].
    Industrial production requires the cooperation and coordination of many, often thousands of workers who face collective action problems as well as colossal transaction costs.
    In the absence of institutions fostering collective action, employers may be able to permanently suppress worker cooperation by attracting individually rational defection.
    Collusion here, as always in atomistic markets --- for better or for worse --- is a [pd]{acronym-label="pd" acronym-form="singular+short"}.

2.  Capital is *easily cooperated and coordinated* into production, if pooling of resources over several capitalists is necessary at all.
    Almost by definition,
    [^79]
    any market economy will provide the institutions to pool capital (such as a public company) and match small owners with large projects and large projects with small owners (for example *convenience denomination* by financial intermediaries).
    By contrast, labor is (again increasingly) unorganized.

3.  Capital can afford to lie idle and forgo a rent.
    Owners can instead convert it into the goods and services of a modern economy.
    Labor cannot afford to be unemployed, as consumption possibilities would then be reduced to the outputs of autonomous subsistence production, which are far below those produced under separation of labor.
    Not trained in, and often prevented from subsistence production, the worker faces the very real possibility of starvation if she does not enter into an agreement with capital.
    In economic terms, labor supply will always be *relatively less price elastic*, compared to capital supply.

As a result, the free market, treating labor and capital equally as commodity, instituted a systemic power imbalance.

#### Redistributive Policy.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:redistributive-policy\]]{#sec:redistributive-policy label="sec:redistributive-policy"}
Government has a number of tools to redistribute market outcomes.
These tools differ in effectiveness and efficiency:
some alleviate only some kinds of market inequality (for example, , p. ), and some are very costly for any given increment of resource redistributed (for example, p. ).

##### Price Controls.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:price-controls\]]{#sec:price-controls label="sec:price-controls"}
Government can respond to inequities by *regulating* price ceilings (such as rent control, in ) or price floors (such as minimum wages, in ).
As intended, binding price controls shift welfare:
consumers gain in surplus from price ceilings, producers gain in surplus from price floors (column 3, row 6 in ).

But they gravely lack in efficiency and effectiveness.

[\[fig:price-floor\]]{#fig:price-floor label="fig:price-floor"}

Efficiency.

:   In addition to the desired, redistributive zero-sum component, price controls also destroy welfare:
    much like taxes (), they cause a [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"}.
    Price controls are a negative-sum allocation.
    Ceilings push prices (say, rents) below equilibrium levels, decrease supply (of flats) and increase demand (for flats), causing excess demand.
    Some potential tenants cannot find good housing, even though they would be willing to pay a higher rent or some potential landlords will not built or improve housing, even though willing tenants could be found.
    Conversely, floors push prices (say, wages) above equilibrium levels and increase supply (of labor) and decreases demand (for labor), causing excess supply (unemployment).
    Some workers cannot find gainful employment, even though they would be willing to work for lower pay or some potential employer will not hire an available worker, because her cost (wage) outweighs her utility (productivity).
    Under binding price ceilings or floors, some otherwise pareto-improving exchanges will not be undertaken, causing decrepit real estate
    [^80]
    or unemployment, respectively.

    Such [dwls]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="plural+short"} are the opposite of gains from trade, they invariably reduce to total consumer (producer) surplus of people able to buy (sell) goods at prices lower (higher) than their reservation price.

    The size of the [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} of price controls depends on the relative price elasticities of supply and demand (just like the , p. ).
    The more price inelastic demand, the smaller is the [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} of price floors:
    even at pushed-up prices, few buyers will be able to exit the market and almost all sellers will find buyers.
    Conversely, the more price inelastic supply, the smaller is the [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} or price ceilings:
    even at pushed-down prices, few sellers will be able to forego sales and almost all buyers will find sellers.

    In the real world, and depends on many factors (p. ).

    In housing markets, supply (landlords) may be inelastic in the short run (for existing housing), but very elastic in the long run (for improved, or new housing).
    [dwls]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="plural+short"} (or decrepit housing) are probably sizeable.
    In labor markets, too, demand (employers) will likely not be price inelastic across the board.
    Often, labor can be substituted by capital.
    Here, too, [dwls]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="plural+short"} (or unemployment) will be sizeable.
    In any case, it will be very hard for states to gauge elasticities and calibrate price controls accordingly to specific industries, time periods and regions.
    [^81]

Effectiveness.

:   Price controls are also limited in their effectiveness.
    They may, in principle --- if at colossal cost and complexity --- redress some of the inequities of markets (p. ), (p. ) and (p. ).
    Short of a near planned economy, they do little to dampen s (p. ):
    consumers can simply buy different (more extravagant) categories of goods, or more of the same to fulfill positional impulses.
    They can also hardly reign in on (p. ).
    By definition, their demand for labor is highly price elastic, given plenty of alternatives.
    Worker supply of labor, absent another employer, is almost perfectly price inelastic.

Governments should, however, respond to monopsony employers in labor markets either by anti-trust action or by leveling the playing field.
Regulating a right to strike and the right to form trade unions can put monopoly employees opposite monopsony employers in collective bargaining.
[^82]
Employment protection and labor contract regulation can also alleviate the power imbalance in labor markets.

##### Affirmative Action.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:affirmative-action\]]{#sec:affirmative-action label="sec:affirmative-action"}
To a limited extent, governments can also respond to winner-take-all markets with affirmative action or equal opportunity legislation.

##### Redistribution by Fiscal Policy

\phantomsection
[\[sec:fiscal-redistribution\]]{#sec:fiscal-redistribution label="sec:fiscal-redistribution"}
The principal redistributive tool of government is a progressive tax, by which government collects more from the rich to pay for public expenditures, and/or finances handouts to the poor.
[^83]

##### Redistribution by Monetary Policy

\phantomsection
[\[sec:distributive-effects-of-inflation\]]{#sec:distributive-effects-of-inflation label="sec:distributive-effects-of-inflation"}
Monetary policy cannot effectively mitigate inequitable market outcomes.
Inflation and deflation redistribute wealth, but not between the rich and the poor.
Instead, inflation redistributes wealth between credits denominated in real terms (for example, house ownership), debts denominated in nominal terms (for example, a fixed-rate mortgage) and credits denominated in nominal terms (for example, fixed-rate pension) and debts denominated in debts denominated in real terms (for example, a futures contract) as summarized in .

\centering
![The distributive effects of inflation, with some examples[]{label="fig:distributive-effects-of-inflation"}](distributive-effects-of-inflation){#fig:distributive-effects-of-inflation width="100%"}

Such arbitrary redistribution does not correspond to of markets (p.) and cannot be defended on normative grounds.
[^84]

Additionally, redistributing by monetary policy causes severe (p. .
Today, as financial products have diversified, redistributing based on denomination and between creditors and debtors will have increasingly arbitrary results.
[^85]

Monetary policy on distributive goals, as on (p.), shines by staying neutral.
It must strive to maintain price stability to avoid any arbitrary and undue distributive effects that would otherwise interfere with the distributive dynamics of state and market.

Consistency Over Time: Saving Tomorrow's Pie {#sec:time}
--------------------------------------------

#### The Human Condition in Time

Human beings are myopic planners [@KahnemanTversky1979].
They discount the future hyberbolically;
the more remote a future event is, the more humans discount its rewards (@Ainslie1975, @Thaler1981).
Human beings also succumb to herding:
they do as others around them do.
Both these frailties can lead to time inconsistency, where we simultaneously hold incompatible preferences for our present and future selves, for example when we would like to retire somewhere warm and mild, but also want a new car every three years.

To be time consistent, we have to do unto future generations (or selves) as we would have them do unto us (the Golden Rule of reciprocity).
Applied to the material world, we have to save --- at least --- at that level, which allows the highest constant level of current and future consumption (@Phelps1966a, @Solow1956).
If we are more generous to our children, or consider technological innovation to be endogenous, we might have to save even more.

Time consistency bears both on equity and efficiency.
An *equitable* policy ensures same (discounted)
[^86]
utility for people living today vs. people living in the future.
An *efficient* policy ensures maximum (discounted) growth over all periods (along the long-term growth path of the economy).

#### Interest

\phantomsection
[\[sec:interest\]]{#sec:interest label="sec:interest"}
In the exchange economy, capital markets align preferences of present and future generations (and selves) by compensating savers with an interest.
Ideally, risk-free interest rates,
[^87]
and other (hedged) returns on capital (for example, stock market indices) equilibrate at that level, where future marginal utility equals present marginal cost of saving.
At this intertemporal optimum,
[^88]
we follow the Golden Rule:
present generations (and selves) *do* unto future generations (and selves) as vice versa.

Under the assumptions of neoclassical orthodoxy, efficient capital markets should guarantee *some* degree of time consistency.

##### Garbage In, Garbage Out.

But because markets are ultimately *aimless* and operate on (assumed!) *exogenous* preferences, the *formal* ability of capital markets for intertemporal optimization is strictly limited.
Interest rates --- as all other prices --- are elegantly aggregated (time) preferences of people.
If these preferences are inconsistent, or amoral, so, too, will be the resulting market "optimum".
As in statistical analyses, no matter the algorithm, the quality of the output depends strictly on the quality of the inputs.

People may be relatively consistent --- or at least our best bet --- to gauge some components of observed discount rates, including the likelihood of exogenous growth (innovation), or continued human existence (compare footnote [\[fn:3components\]](#fn:3components){reference-type="ref" reference="fn:3components"} (p. ).
For these components, people may input reasonably good 'data', and markets will output reasonably good prices.

By contrast, the 'data quality' of *pure discount component rate of the future* --- discounting future utility simply because it lies in the future --- is deeply questionable for reasons (compare footnote [\[fn:3components\]](#fn:3components){reference-type="ref" reference="fn:3components"} (p. ):

1.  *Inconsistency.*
    People are, as cognitive psychology has shown, *time inconsistent* even in their own lives, and the short- to medium term (@Ainslie1975, @Thaler1981).
    If they are similarly inconsistent when deciding how much saving to supply at any given interest rate, *overall* interest rates will be distorted.
    Myopic individuals will *cause* the very inflated interest rates meant to keep their short-sightedness in check, and overall saving will be too low.
    [^89]

2.  *Morality.*
    As [@Samuelson2005 54] has recently reminded us, *term uncertainty*, especially pure discounting of the future is a *normative concern*.
    Just how much we value the welfare of future generations and selves is a *moral* judgement.
    There is nothing in our nature or our environment that could positively tell us what a *true* rate would be, there are only normative judgments of what a *right* rate should be.
    Once people have agreed on such a rate, markets can do the @Hayek1931ian number crunching.
    But markets, because they will accept *any* rate as input, cannot solve this moral problem for us.
    Instead, only a democratic polity --- and its government --- can decide the pure discount rate.

    People often say they want their children to live a *better* life.
    If similar sentiments are deeply-held and widespread, people might democratically decide to save *more* than intertemporal *equity* demands.
    If indeed, we shall give to our children *better*, than we ourselves received, we are at least looking for a *Kaldor-Hicks* (not Pareto!) improvement without and above the equilibrium capital return.

Even ignoring such substantive concerns, real world capital markets are also plagued by *formal* intertemporal failures, causing their own costly and inequitable time inconsistency.
The capitalist algorithm not only receives bad inputs, but it is also ridden with bugs, that fail both in the short and the long term.

#### Short-Term Intertemporal Failures {#sec:short-term-inconsistency}

Economic activity tends to fluctuate in the short-term.

##### Business cycles

are periodic fluctuations, typically relatively mild in amplitude and slope.
They are endogenously caused by lumpy, lagged decision-making of market participants, for example in inventory cycles.
[^90]

According to the dissenting, minority view, business cycles are *true* shocks that may or may not be endogenously amplified, but are exogenous in origin (@Kydland1982).
[^91]

##### Bubbles and panics

can lead to abrupt and dramatic fluctuations in economic activity, with great slope and amplitude.
Bubbles and panics envelope market actors when they make their decisions based on the anticipated decisions of others, in a beauty-contest type game [@Keynes1936].
Similar rationales also emerge when making privately informed decisions creates a positive externality for other participants to free-ride on your inadvertently disclosed information [@Banerjee-1992-aa].
[^92]

##### Fluctuations are Costly.

Both types of fluctuations in economic activity are inefficient because they temporarily leave factors of production idle (overused) and increase periodic transaction costs.
Fluctuations leave factors of production (for example, an assembly line) idle during the downturn or building up excess capacities during the upturn (for example, a real estate overhang).
Additionally, fluctuations cause unnecessary adjustment costs (for example, storing equipment).
The costs of short-term fluctuations are particularly virulent in labor markets, where hiring is expensive and unemployment can degrade worker morale.
Aside from these material costs, short-term and uncertain employment (and economic prospects in general) cause stress and hardship.

Such idleness or mania diverts the economy away from its (exogenously) long-term growth path and thereby slows down the economies progress along the growth path.

By contrast, "true" exogenous shocks (such as an earthquake) or genuinely new information about future utility of present savings (for example, because of a new technology) is not a deviation from, but a *shift* of the long-term growth path.
It is, for better or for worse, unavoidable.

#### Short-term: State responses

States can respond by regulatory, fiscal and monetary means to reduce the frequency, depth and duration of economic fluctuations.
In the following, I discuss the state responses to a downward deviation from the long-term growth path of the economy.
States should likewise, if with opposite sign, respond to upward deviations from long-term growth.

##### Regulatory

States can reign in on short-term downturns simply by outlawing respective actions of market participants.
[epl]{acronym-label="epl" acronym-form="singular+short"}, for example, can include lay-off protection, making it harder for employers to fire workers in a downturn.
Other regulatory interventions include the bans on short-selling of recent 2007ff fame.

Regulatory responses can be effective, but blunt instruments as they also affect economic activity outside of endogenous downturns.
Generous lay-off protection, for instance, can cause a [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} of unemployment during upturns, keeping the economy under its long-term growth path.
Regulatory interventions can also fail to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous fluctuations in the economy overall and some of its markets.
[^93]
As collateral damage, generous lay-off protection may prevent workers from moving to new, more productive firms and sectors (for example services rather than mining).
Similarly, bans on short-selling may prevent or defer necessary market readjustment in case of real, exogenous price shocks (for example, a war in an oil-exporting country).

##### Fiscal Stimulus.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:fiscal-stimulus\]]{#sec:fiscal-stimulus label="sec:fiscal-stimulus"}
States can also respond to short-term downturns by propping up aggregate demand, following @Keynes1936ian demand management.
[^94]

By definition, to push up aggregate demand, government must *dissave*.
Fiscal stimulus must be paid out of newly issued debt, or prior savings --- but it cannot be paid out of increased *current* period tax revenues, for such hikes would cut private demand, as public demand expands.
[^95]
Still, even *deficit spending* will *crowd out* some private demand, as it soaks up savings in capital markets.
Government bonds must be sold to someone, and that someone will not be able to spend or invest that same money elsewhere.

Luckily for government (and all of us), it can target its spending wisely to those areas where it will have a maximum *multiplier effect*, that is, where demand begets as much more demand as possible.
For example, when government procures a new railroad line, these construction workers will have more resources to spend on entertainment, or invest in a family home.

Of course, government demand is not the only demand that multiplies;
private demand also multiplies.
However, because government (ideally) aims *not* to maximize profit, but overall economic recovery, it can seek out that spending that maximizes multiplication.
Private demand, by contrast, will seek maximum profit at low risk, which, in economic downturns, is often found in a "flight to safety", hoarding of cash or equivalents.

A good stabilizer should go entirely into immediate consumption or investment, and possibly incentivize further dissaving.
[^96]

While easier to understand for the often maligned deficit spending type of stimulus, governments must trade off the multiplication effect versus the crowding out effect during *all* fiscal expansions.
Even when (or rather, hypothetically, *if*) governments were to pay for stimulus "out of pocket", these now dispersed savings were collected at an earlier time, ever since they crowded out that same amount in private demand.

Maximizing multiplied demand, for every increment of demand crowded out is a challenge that government must always face in fiscal expansion.
Where to best direct resources is an empirical question for econometricians, statistical physicists and other experts that I happily need not, and cannot engage here.

*Automatic stabilizers*
can support demand without legislative intervention.
They include unemployment insurance
[^97]
and short-time working benefits, both of which smooth out (consumer) demand by substituting the market income of laid-off, or shorted workers.
[^98]

*Discretionary stabilizers*
are often called for when bubbles, panics or amplified shocks cause output fluctuations too large and fast to be captured by automatic stabilizers.
They come in the form of tax breaks, stimulus subsidies or public investment.
They, too, rely on dissaving, and the incurred debt must be repaid in good times.

*Side effects.*
As all potent drugs, fiscal stimulus must be prescribed with great care.
It has at least two dangerous side effects:

1.  *Structural painkiller.*
    All stabilizers can disguise real needs for adjustment as cyclical problems, further diverting an economy from its equilibrium and long-term growth path.

2.  *Playing favors.*
    Especially discretionary stabilizers are also prone to clientelism, that easily creeps in when legislatures pass often very targeted stimulus packages.
    When specific decisions are made, rather than general rules passed [@Weber-1918-aa], as discretionary stabilizers require, special interests are more likely to gain the upper hand.
    [^99]

##### Monetary Stimulus.

[\[sec:monetary-stimulus\]]{#sec:monetary-stimulus label="sec:monetary-stimulus"}
Government can also prop up the economy in the short run by monetary stimulus.
[^100].
Government injects more cash into the economy, to make up for liquidity frozen up during the downturn, thereby (p. )[^101]

The monetary contraction in the course of an endogenous downturn can best be described as a general loss of confidence in the profitability of future projects (such as investments).
As market participants become squeamish about economic prospects in general, they hoard cash (or equivalents) or flee to safety (such as gold, or --- before 2009 --- government bonds).
[^102]
Less funding is available even for the most profitable and unrisky projects and the lack of liquidity can render (balance sheet) solvent firms (cash flow) insolvent.
The money supply contracts.
When these defaults further feed the market panic and cause more debts to sour, a self-reinforcing debt-deflation crises may ensue.

A monetary stimulus bolsters market confidence by essentially placing an optimistic, massively government-backed bet.
When central banks resort to quantitative or qualitative easing, they declare whichever assets they buy or collateral they accept as worthwhile (profitable) investments by fiat.
When, if and to the extent that markets buy into this stunt of optimism, they will be increasingly willing to lend the injected (and their own) money again, too.

Monetary stimulus has some drawbacks, too.
Monitoring the money supply in the economy is very difficult and imprecise, and related policy imperatives are incompletely understood.
To avoid inflation, central banks must contract their money supply again as soon as the monetary stimulus has worked, and market liquidity has recovered.
The timing and calibration of interventions to maintain a constant money supply are crucial, but difficult to get right.

Monetary stimulus, too, can disguise and defer unavoidable realignment when the cause of the downturn is exogenous, such as a true price shock (as for example when revised Greek fiscal numbers became available in 2008).
When the long-term growth path is shifted (downward), the money supply *must* contract in absolute terms as the underlying economy, too, will contract, or at least grow slower than previously expected.
Monetary stimulus does not allow economies to live beyond their real, exogenous means for long;
it just defers the pain to a later contraction or risks inflation, which in turn (p. .

#### Long-Term Inconsistency {#sec:long-term-inconsistency}

##### Market problems

The market institution of equilibrium interest rates may fail to guide humans to temporal consistency in the long run for three reasons.

1.  (Exogenous) growth theory discussed so far assumes technology to be constant, or exogenous:
    as if the rate at which new technology is discovered cannot be altered by humans.
    Accordingly, once a maximum steady-state output is achieved, further *capital deepening* or other policy will be inconsequential for growth.
    Exogenous technological innovation appears unreasonable in a knowledge-based economy (as recently endorsed in @Communities2009).
    When we *can* endogenously improve our creativity, we might have to save more to achieve intertemporal Kaldor-Hicks improvements.

    Additionally, markets may fail to adequately save for and invest in fundamental [rnd]{acronym-label="rnd" acronym-form="singular+short"}, because innovation is often a (p. ).
    Market innovation may also be hampered by under asymmetric information (p. ).

2.  Ancillary conditions frequently observed in post-industrial economies imply *real* (public or private) and require offsetting, greater *nominal* savings (p. ).
    They include aging,
    [^103]
    structural unemployment,
    [^104]
    or, equivalently, (p. ), underprovided public goods (basic research?) and overused common goods (@Stern-2006-aa:
    climate change!).
    Markets can, by definition, not provide these goods or solve these problems, and to the extent that government (or lovers) have neglected to do so in the past, these failures constitutes real dissavings.

3.  Market return rates on capital set a saving rate by equilibrating *self-interest*.
    Savings rates, however, are a public good, which cannot be provided out of self-interested exchange.
    One person's saving bestows a positive externality on other people in two ways:

    1.  When technological change is held to be *exogenous*, other people will benefit from capital deepening and approximating of steady-state growth.

    2.  When technological change is allowed to be endogenous, these benefits include greater economy-wide productivity and innovation and will be even larger.

    Markets, when left to their own devices, will save less than optimal because not all of the societal benefit can be recouped in interest payments.

##### Government Saving.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:government-saves\]]{#sec:government-saves label="sec:government-saves"}
If the polity has democratically prescribed a savings rate and/or the market fails to save at positively optimal levels, government can prop up saving by regulatory and fiscal means.

In *regulatory* policy, government can mandate citizens to save into a pension or other saving scheme.
[^105]
Mandatory pensions and similar financial products solve time inconsistency both at the individual level (present and future self) and the societal level (present and future generations).

The difference between fiscal and regulatory policy I draw in (p.  is a bit murky and overdrawn, when it comes to saving.
Here is my attempt to draw it anyway:

Regulatory

:   I treat policy as regulatory, when it ties made contributions to *entitled benefits* later in life.
    Much like when it is fencing the commons, government guarantees legally enforceable, quasi-property in both private and public pension schemes.

    Such a regulatory pension scheme, tying benefits to contributions, organises intertemporal production (saving) and distribution (dissaving) in a *single* institution --- much like the market economy does.
    [^106]

Fiscal

:   I treat a policy as fiscal, when contributions do *not* entitle payers to specific benefits.
    By definition, this is what taxes do.

    In fiscal policy, government can encourage private saving with clever subsidies or save resources itself by raising more taxes than spending in the current period.
    Government can invest budget surpluses in publicly run projects such as education or infrastructure, or privately run enterprises in [swfs]{acronym-label="swf" acronym-form="plural+short"} (here again, the public-private is irrelevant to the saving component (p. ).

    Such a fiscal intertemporal regime keeps intertemporal production (saving) and distribution (dissaving) apart.
    Each step in the intertemporal deal requires a separate political decision.
    For example, government will have to decide when to auction off [swfs]{acronym-label="swf" acronym-form="plural+short"} and what to use the revenue for.

Convergence Over Space: Growing the Pie Smoothly {#sec:space}
------------------------------------------------

#### The Human Condition of Space

Humans have evolved in small, intimately known groups of hunters and gatherers of no more than a few hundred individuals, covering a relatively small area of Earth in their lifetime (popularized, reviewed in @Diamond1997).
In evolutionary terms, mass society and fast travel are recent developments.
And so we may be ever disposed to parochially define our context in terms of locale (and ethny)
[^107]
(for example, @Van-den-Berghe-1981-aa).

When we let our parochial sentiments make policy, economically costly autarky results.
We are rich and prosperous, because at the national, regional and global level we are integrated by organic solidarity of *functional* differentiation, not the mechanical kind of locale and ethny [@Durkheim-1893-aa].
Under modernity, autarky is always regression.

The cosmopolitan mindset transcends our parochial heritage, and defines our group and place in the most encompassing, radically modern way:
species homo sapiens on planet Earth.
This is the jurisdiction of human rights, the scope of science and the marketplace of economic liberalisation.

However, modernity and prosperity have not arrived nor progressed simultaneously everywhere, but the have swollen very differently (p. ).
Our world, today, is a very unequal place.

#### Market Solutions

\phantomsection
[\[sec:trade\]]{#sec:trade label="sec:trade"}
Markets offer the institution of trade to mediate between our parochial tendencies and the cosmopolitan demands of our modern world.
Trade kindles our self-interest, binds us to strangers far away, increases our common welfare and, sometimes, makes us more equal, too.

In the following I (very) briefly describe four mainstream trade theories and highlight their welfare and distributive effects, but will have to ignore much real world complexity and empirical refinement (for another review with empirical evidence, see @Beckfield2009).

I here apply the paradigms of trade theory to commerce *within* an idealized, closed economy, even though trade is traditionally understood as *inter-state* exchanges between two or more open economies.
However, some of the same basic dynamics also govern welfare and distribution *inside* one closed economy.
Of course, those institutions that differ from one open economy to another --- including monetary policy, trade barriers and factor mobility --- do not apply to trade within the closed economy:
there is only one money, no tariffs or quotas, and great (if not perfect) capital and labor mobility.
But the overall dynamics of divergence and convergence are always the same.
In fact, thinking, as we do, *differently* about commerce *within* a country, and trade *between* countries is an exercise in cognitive compartmentalization (Gabbard 2010), and it often borders on mercantilism or reeks off nationalist sentiment.

##### Four Trade Theories

\phantomsection
[\[sec:trade-theories\]]{#sec:trade-theories label="sec:trade-theories"}
Trade is always and everywhere the voluntary exchange between people who differ in location, ability or something else of economic value.
Trade is, in short, the mode of a market economy.
We know of at least four different theories to explain growth, convergence and divergence under trade:

Absolute Advantage

:   [\[itm:absolute-advantage\]]{#itm:absolute-advantage label="itm:absolute-advantage"}
    Trade on absolute advantage occurs between at least two parties that can produce different goods at the cheapest cost [@Smith-1776-lq].
    [^108]
    The parties will both specialize in whichever good they can produce more efficiently, and trade the surplus production (over their domestic demand) for goods other parties have an absolute advantage in producing.
    All parties benefit from greater overall productivity.
    Aggregate output increases:
    everyone gets richer.

    Crucially, when a party has no absolute advantage in producing any good, it will not trade at all.

    The benefits are divided according to productivity.
    In @Smith-1776-lqian trade, everybody gains, if not equally.
    It exploits exogenous productivity differences, but does not otherwise lead to convergence in productivities or prosperity.

Comparative Advantage

:   [\[itm:comparative-advantage\]]{#itm:comparative-advantage label="itm:comparative-advantage"}
    Trade on comparative advantage occurs between parties that produce different goods at *relatively* different productivities [@Ricardo1817].
    [^109]
    A party will specialize in that good, for which they have to give up the least other production (opportunity costs).
    The party then trades the surplus production (over their domestic demand) for goods other parties have a comparative advantage in producing.

    Trade on comparative advantage increases overall output.
    A party will trade, even if it has no absolute advantage in producing any good.

    The benefits of trade are divided according to the terms of trade.
    In Ricardian trade, too, everybody gains, but not equally.
    It exploits exogenous productivity differences, but does not otherwise lead to convergence in productivities or prosperity.

Factor Price Equalization

:   [\[itm:FPE\]]{#itm:FPE label="itm:FPE"}
    According to the [fpe]{acronym-label="fpe" acronym-form="singular+short"} theorem, parties trade with parties that differ in their factor endowments (such as labor and capital) [@Stolper1941].
    [^110]
    A party will specialize in producing goods intensive in their more abundant factor and trade the surplus production (over their domestic demand) for goods other parties have specialized in.

    Overall output increases, as factors are put to the most productive use.

    Within the party, the relative factor returns change as trade commences.
    The relatively more abundant factor (in rich countries, capital) is in higher demand and reaps a higher return.
    The relatively less abundant factor (in poor countries, low-skilled labor) is in higher demand and reaps a higher return.
    Over the long run, according to [@Stolper1941] specialization continues until all factors are equally abundant in all parties, and command equal returns (prices).

    Between the parties, according to Hekscher-Ohlin trade, everybody gains, but not equally.
    It equalizes factor prices, but does not further convergence of endowments or prosperity.
    Immediately, specializing according to factor endowments can reinforce exogenous, pre-existing inequality:
    as a (human) capital-poor party opens to trade, the return on capital (education)
    [^111]
    may fall.

Economies of Scale

:   [\[itm:NTT\]]{#itm:NTT label="itm:NTT"}
    According to *[ntt]{acronym-label="ntt" acronym-form="singular+short"}*, parties trade with one another not to exploit any exogenous, pre-existing difference in productivities or endowments, but because specialization itself pays [@Krugman-1980-aa].
    [^112]

    A party will specialize in the goods in which it is already specialized, or at the least, in which no other party is specialized to produce at competitive prices.
    Similarly, a group of geographically (or otherwise) clustered parties will specialize in one category of goods (food in north-western France) or one industrial sector (automobile in southern Germany), to benefit from specific resources (specialized labor) and networks (for example, supply chain, trade fair).

    In [ntt]{acronym-label="ntt" acronym-form="singular+short"}, overall output increases, as more production happens at higher scale and dense networks are efficiently shared.
    [ntt]{acronym-label="ntt" acronym-form="singular+short"} also implies significant distributive effects:
    whoever specializes first and is closely clustered, wins.
    This *agglomeration* may increase spatial inequality and counteract convergence.
    In extreme cases, economies of scale and network effects may breed monopoly or oligopoly producers, causing additional distributive effects and welfare losses.

##### Balance of payments

In the short and medium term parties can defer all of the distributive effects of trade by running *current account deficits*, including trade deficits.
Current account deficits are offset by *capital account surpluses*, including sales of domestic assets and issued debt.
In the long run current account deficits (and counterparty surpluses) built up untenable imbalances and can trigger *balance of payments crises*.
At the end of the day, current account deficits cannot persist but must be (p. ).
Running current account deficits may defer the distributive pain (at a cost), but cannot avoid it.

In the final analysis, trade deficits, surpluses (and capital account deficits, surpluses respectively) are meaningful only net of trade with *all* other parties.
If party A has a a trade deficit with party B, which has a trade deficit with party C, which has a trade deficit with party A, overall current accounts may be balanced.
Only the net deficit trade distilled into capital account surpluses (debt or foreign ownership) matters for economic imbalances.

This can be explained with reference to personal finance.
All people except for suppliers and employees run a "trade deficit" with their local supermarket;
yet, as long as they have offsetting surpluses with other parties (for example, their clients), they may be financially sound.
Only if they spend more than they earn (or own), will they be in trouble.

##### Adjustment costs

\phantomsection
[\[sec:adjustment-costs\]]{#sec:adjustment-costs label="sec:adjustment-costs"}
All of the above four trade models assume costless adjustment of the economy.
As some sectors wax and others wane in the course of specialization, factors of production (capital, labor) are transferred from one use to another with no cost.
This is an unrealistic assumption.
Specialized capital (machinery) or (trained) labor may not be useful in another industry without some retooling or retraining, if at all.

Adjustment costs must be subtracted from the *welfare* gains of trade.

To the extent that adjustment costs are concentrated in one party or industry, as they are likely to be, adjustment also has "domestic" *distributive* effects.
People who have a stake in the industry favored by trade, such as trained workers and owners win.
Workers and owners in declining industries lose.

##### Factor Mobility

\phantomsection
[\[sec:factor-mobility-trade\]]{#sec:factor-mobility-trade label="sec:factor-mobility-trade"}
Modeling the spatial dimension of a closed market economy on international trade theories may appear as a bit of a stretch.

The analogy works only to the extent that factors of production stick to place and industry.
By definition, labor and especially capital face no *formal*, spatial boundaries *within* the closed economy.
In a perfectly mobile labor and capital market, none of the above distributive effects would apply:
factories and workers would fluidly and without cost move to wherever they can earn most, counteracting any spatial factor rent differentials.

In the real world, neither capital nor labor is perfectly mobile, and to that extent, trade theory applies.
[^113]

Domestic and international trade are subject to essentially the same economic dynamics.
They differ not dichotomously, but gradually, depending on factor mobility.

If I have stretched the concept of international trade here, it is to show that the closed, mixed economy experiences the same welfare and distributive dynamics, and has, as I explain in the following section, found policy responses to mitigate them.

#### Government Solutions

Government can forge spatial convergence to counteract divergent trade dynamics by fiscal, and to a lesser extent, by regulatory means.

##### Regulatory Policy

According to (neo)classical economic doctrine, to allow everyone to partake in and gain from trade government should "fight factor market rigidities" (a euphemism for letting wages fall and consumer prices rise).

Two welfare state institutions are frequently blamed for wage rigidities:

1.  Formal minimum wages or income-substitution benefits can establish effective price floors in labor markets and cause a [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} of unemployment, or, in the terms of trade theory, a group or region of people with no absolute advantage.
    [^114]

2.  Powerful trade unions and corporatist style collective bargaining can make wages (especially downward) rigid.

To further trade, or, equivalently, clear labor markets, government should avoid price floors and, if found downwardly rigid, tamper or bust trade unions.
[^115]
Both these measures will have adverse (vertical) distributive consequences, which government may counteract with fiscal transfers.
Again, as I argued earlier, to distribute vertically (p. ).
Equity can best be achieved by fiscal measures.

In international trade, government can protect "infant industry" to remedy the distributive dynamics of Hekscher-Ohlin trade and to check agglomeration by setting import tariffs or quotas.
Under the shield of protection, the economies accumulate capital (or high-skilled labor) until it becomes the more abundant factor and join international trade to participate (in arguably more value-adding) capital-intensive production.
Alternatively, protection allows domestic firms or sectors to grow to a scale and density that allows them to reap returns to scale and network effects before they enter international competition.
By definition, there are no tariffs or quotas *within* the closed economy, so government cannot *protect* infant industries.

##### Fiscal Policy

Government can nurse infant industries, by pursuing industrial or structural policy.
[^116]
In industrial policy, government forges capital deepening, builds forward-looking infrastructure and favors "picked winners" in sectors and firms.
Similarly, structural policy supports underperforming regions or sectors by granting subsidies or tax breaks.

The toolset of industrial and structural policy is varied and complex, often centered on fiscal means, but also including a banking regime, ownership structure, corporate governance and institutions in education and training (for an impressive survey of different configurations of these interlinked institutions, see @HallSoskice-2001-aa).

Government intervention in the economy is also rightfully controversial.
Instead of nurturing infant, but promising industry, it can protect sclerotic, inefficient sectors doomed for "creative destruction" [@SchumpeterSwedberg-1942-aa].
In the worst case, industrial and structural policy succumbs to clientelism and turns into crony capitalism.
Famously, *picking winners*, in industries and regions, is very hard and government may be particularly bad at it.
Both the targeting and timing of government support for regions, industries and firms are tricky.

Subsidies must be *targeted* at industries that later can successfully compete in an open market.
Government often has limited knowledge or ability to make these calls, and clientelist politics easily creeps in.

Subsidies must also be *timed* to reliably recede, to put sufficient pressure on industry to become competitive and to avoid windfalls.
Phase out a subsidy too soon, and the industry dies.
End it too late, or never, and you invite rent-seekers.

More broadly and less targeted, government can address spatial inequities of trade by transfers payments.
As subsidies, tax breaks or funding for local government, central government can compensate for adjustment costs, give side-payments to losers from trade and generally smooth structural change.
Progressive transfers can also dampen self-reinforcing agglomeration and counteract suppressed factor returns.

##### Monetary Policy

By definition, a closed economy only has one currency, and thereby, one monetary policy.
Consequently, monetary policy cannot affect the spatial dimension of economic activity *within* that closed economy.

## The Means of a Mixed Economy 

> *"The revenue of the state *is* the state."*\
> --- Edmund @Burke1790 [111, emphasis added]

To pursue the (p. ) of (p. ), (p. ), (p. ), (p. ) and (p. ), the mixed economy relies on an intact set of (p. ), (p. ) and (p. ) means.

Effectively commanding regulation, taxation and fiat money is not trivial.
To be effective, these institutions of the mixed economy must be designed to *anticipate* and *minimize* adverse interactions with the independent market economy.
As is the defining feature of the mixed economy, (p. ), both in its policy *ends* and *means*.

The Means of Regulatory Policy {#sec:regulatory}
------------------------------

Effective regulatory policy is (p. ) but (p. ), and always (p. ) with the reach of economic activity.

Capability.

:   [\[itm:capability\]]{#itm:capability label="itm:capability"}
    To regulate economic activity, government must command an effective monopoly on the use of force and possess the administrative capability to pass, monitor and enforce regulation.

    Regulation will often be exceedingly complex and require frequent modification and government must be equipped to keep up with the creativity and dynamism of private business.
    [^117]

Restraint.

:   [\[itm:restraint\]]{#itm:restraint label="itm:restraint"}
    On the other hand, the regulatory power of government must also be strictly limited by the rule of law, particularly the right to property, and the norms of good governance.
    Markets must be protected from arbitrary or unpredictable regulation of the economy that would disrupt their smooth functioning.

    Restrained government maximizes planning reliability for market participants, protects their confidence and avoids retroactive effects.
    [^118]

Congruence.

:   [\[itm:congruence\]]{#itm:congruence label="itm:congruence"}
    Lastly, the scope of regulation must match that of the economic activity in question.
    [^119]

    When regulation covers an area smaller than the respective market, *regulatory arbitrage* ensues.
    For example, when health and safety in manufacturing are regulated at the county level, factories will relocate to wherever the rules are laxest.
    Because manufactured goods can easily be moved, consumers in the strictly regulated county will buy (cheaper) goods produced under lax conditions.
    Regulation at the county level will be ineffective.
    When local jurisdiction have an incentive to attract manufacturing such as employment or tax revenue, standards may equilibrate at a the (low) Nash equilibrium in a [pd]{acronym-label="pd" acronym-form="singular+short"}-type game.
    When jurisdiction and the mobility of factors and goods does not match, a *race to the bottom* may ensue.
    [^120]
    Conversely, when the scope of regulation far exceeds that of markets, government may overreach and violate norms of *subsidiarity*.
    For example, when health and safety of hairdressers are regulated at the national level, hypothetical regional or local differences in customer preferences would be negated for no compelling reason.
    People will usually not travel to get a haircut, and haircuts cannot be transported.
    Regulatory arbitrage is hence unlikely to occur.
    Local government is free to set training standards at whichever level its electorate sees fit, without fear of hairdressers relocating or customers fleeing to other, laxer jurisdictions.
    [^121]
    As @Bordo2011 put it, *this* is the "*raison d'être*" [-@Bordo2011 4] for fiscal federalism, as defined by [@Oates1972].

    In the closed economy, government can always regulate at the largest possible scope of markets, the national level.
    By definition, no relocation or trade beyond the closed economy are possible.
    Central government can devolve jurisdiction to local government according to market scope, as it sees fit.

The Means Fiscal Policy {#sec:fiscal}
-----------------------

To redistribute market outcomes, fund public goods and natural monopolies or to change market incentives, government relies on the treasury.
These fiscal activities in (p. ) differ by and , summarized in (p. ):

Base.

:   \phantomsection
    [\[itm:base\]]{#itm:base label="itm:base"}
    Fiscal revenue generation differs in its *nominal* base, or *what is taxed*.
    [^122]

Schedule.

:   \phantomsection
    [\[itm:schedule\]]{#itm:schedule label="itm:schedule"}
    Obligatory transfers differ in their desired schedule.
    They can apply to everyone at a *flat* rate, *proportional*, or *progressive*, charging the fortunate above a linear tariff on their ability to pay (or , p. ).

Differing in base and schedule, fiscal activities fall in three broad categories:

\phantomsection
[\[sec:levies\]]{#sec:levies label="sec:levies"}
fund (p. ), including suboptimal saving.
[^123]

In english, they are also known as Pigouvian *taxes*, which is imprecise, because they are no proper taxes.
In german, they are known as literally "steering taxes" (*Lenkungssteuern*), which is apt, because they are meant to change market activity.

Pigouvian levies are *specific* in base:
only whoever uses common good pays.

Pigouvian levies --- ideally --- are scheduled at *marginal cost*:
everyone pays for the increment by which she has exhausted the common good.
Equivalently, everyone pays according to the marginal social cost they inflict on everyone else.

<!-- %	\subparagraph{\hyperref[sec:common-good]{Common Goods} and \hyperref[sec:natural-monopoly]{Natural Monopolies}} should both be financed out of specific levies.
%For common goods, these take the form of Pigouvian levies, pricing in the costs of using the non-excludable, but rival commons.
%For natural monopolies, these take the form of fees, ideally at average (not marginal) costs of production collected by the state or a publicy-owned firm.

%As the rate of the levy is determined only by the costs of producing the respective good or service, a schedule does not apply. -->


\phantomsection
[\[sec:fees\]]{#sec:fees label="sec:fees"}
fund (p. ).

Fees are *specific* in base:
only whoever benefits from a natural monopoly pays.

Fees are scheduled at *average* cost:
everyone pays the same share of the overall cost, no matter how much she added in incremental cost (see footnote [\[fn:why-ac-fees\]](#fn:why-ac-fees){reference-type="ref" reference="fn:why-ac-fees"}, p. ).

\phantomsection
[\[sec:taxes\]]{#sec:taxes label="sec:taxes"}
fund all remaining government outlays, including those for .

Taxes, no matter their use, are *general* in base:
everyone pays unconditionally, and without individualized return.
[^124]

Taxes can be scheduled to achieve *any* desired redistribution, even though most would understand redistribution to imply at least a proportional or progressive schedule.

<!-- %	\subparagraph{\hyperref[sec:fiscal-redistribution]{Redistributive} taxes} should, by definition, be general in incidence and proportional or progressive on ability to pay, depending on the chosen equity norm.
%A \emph{specific} redistributive tax is a contradiction in terms:
%redistributing only between some entities in turn constitutes a redistribution between the included and the exempted entities.
%Moreover, specific inclusion or exemption of entities based on something other than the accepted equity norm (for example, ability to pay) conflicts with liberal-democratic norms of non-discrimination. -->

Taxes meant to raise general revenue to finance all remaining outlays (see , p. ) imply only a flat, or per-capita schedule.
Funding, for example,

,
[^125]

,
[^126]

\hyperref[sec:fiscal-stimulus]{stimulus}
[^127]
or

\hyperref[sec:government-saves]{government saving}
imply flat schedules:
these programs are all about maximizing welfare, have universal coverage and justify no redistribution.
However,
[\[sec:fiscal-redistribution-and-revenue-are-one\]]{#sec:fiscal-redistribution-and-revenue-are-one label="sec:fiscal-redistribution-and-revenue-are-one"}
because redistributive taxes for equity and general-revenue taxes for welfare share the *same base*, they can also be rolled up in one combined schedule.
In addition to cutting redundant administration, taxing only according to one schedule makes more sense.
When two taxes have overlapping objectives, such as a general base, their parallel implementation may conflict.
This is also the case for general revenue and redistributive taxes, simply because a flat financing of, for example, public goods, already embodies *one* --- possibly contested --- equity norm.

#### A Norm of Ordoliberal Hygiene.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:ordoliberal-hygiene\]]{#sec:ordoliberal-hygiene label="sec:ordoliberal-hygiene"}
These three categories of obligatory payments to the treasury --- Pigouvian levies, fees and taxes --- are different public policy beasts entirely, and must not be confused.

<!-- % \cite{Dwyer2009} 340:
%Indeed, Leicht and Fitzgerald (2006) argue that the middle class has been ‘lent what it should have been paid’ and that a middle-class lifestyle was maintained during a time of stagnant income growth for many at the cost of financial security. -->

<!-- %\paragraph{Redistributive Taxes and General Revenue are One} The remaining fiscal instruments with the goals to redistribute and raise general revenue are treated as one.
%There is no meaningful distinction between taxes that are meant to redistribute (or its progressive element) and those (or that component), which is meant to finance public/common goods or collectivize risk.
%
%A separate treatment of the merely redistributive component of taxation and its revenue generating element is unnecessary because the population concerned, is, in theses cases, everyone (by definition), and hence same.
%
%We can then implement the degree of redistribution that is required over the entire range of general revenue generating taxes.

%\paragraph{A Norm of Ordoliberal Hygiene.} This typology of fiscally relevant state interventions into the market carries implications for the efficient design of a tax.

%General and specific fiscal interventions follow, in fact, two \emph{opposite} logics.

%A Pigouvian tax or fee is meant to fall on those very market interactions they are raised to discourage or finance.
%Pigouvian taxes \emph{should} change relative costs in the market vis-a-vis the status quo to reduce otherwise overconsumption of commons.
%An efficient local sewage system fee \emph{will} fall only on actual private or business use of the system, and not on other activity, say, a sewage-free server farm.

%General taxes to redistribute, pool risks or finance public goods, by contrast, should, to \hyperref[sec:DWL]{minimize their deadweight loss} (desideratum \ref{des:minimal-DWL}) on otherwise Pareto-optimal markets leave relative prices unchanged.

%From this follows a norm of ordoliberal hygiene to keep these two types of fiscally relevant state interventions into the market apart.
%Because I am not concerned with Pigouvian levies and fees here, I exclude them from the following in desideratum \ref{des:ordoliberal-hygiene}. -->

[\[des:ordoliberal-hygiene\]]{#des:ordoliberal-hygiene label="des:ordoliberal-hygiene"}
A desirable tax should not include any Pigouvian or fee-like components.

Neither Pigouvian levies nor fees should be designed to redistribute or raise *any* general revenue.
Conversely a redistributive or general revenue tax should not alter behavior.

General and specific fiscal interventions follow, in fact, two *opposing* logics:
A Pigouvian levy or fee is meant to fall on those very market interactions they are raised to discourage or finance.
Pigouvian levies *should* change relative costs in the market vis-a-vis the status quo to reduce otherwise overconsumption of commons.
General revenue or redistributive taxes, by contrast, should leave relative costs and levels of market activity unaffected, otherwise, a [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} ensues.
An efficient local sewage system fee *will* fall only on actual private or business use of the system, and not on other activity, say, a sewage-free server farm.
[^128]

Of course, Pigouvian levies and fees sometimes cause undesired distributive effects.
For example, taxes on fuel consumption often hit lower and middle class people hardest.
Still, government should not alter a Pigouvian schedule, let alone issue offsetting subsidies, such as the German commuter tax relief ("Pendlerpauschale").
Instead, government should use general-base redistribution for equity.

#### Redistribution and Revenue-Generation are One.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:fiscal-redistributionAndRevenueAreOne\]]{#sec:fiscal-redistributionAndRevenueAreOne label="sec:fiscal-redistributionAndRevenueAreOne"}
On the other hand, this typology of fiscally relevant state interventions also suggests that redistributive and revenue-generating taxes for and provision of can be consolidated into one.

The desired general incidence in both these classes of taxes implies that the universe of taxable entities is the same.

Redistributive and general revenue taxes *should* be rolled into one for two reasons.
economicus

Administrative Ease.

:   The collection of any tax will be administratively costly.
    Implementing fewer taxes will be cheaper.
    The flat or proportional schedule of revenue generation can be easily included in a redistributive (proportional or progressive) schedule as a base rate.

General Revenue and Redistribution Interact.

:   When two taxes have overlapping objectives, such as a general base, their parallel implementation may conflict.
    This is also the case for general revenue and redistributive taxes, simply because a flat or proportional financing of pooled risks and public goods already embodies *one* --- possibly contested --- equity norm.

    A flat or proportional financing of general revenue, could, for instance, conflict with efficiency desideratum des:low-price-floor in .
    Conversely, *levels* of risk pooling and public good provision are shown to bear equity consequences in .

A desirable tax exclusively finances general revenue and redistributes through a single schedule.
[\[des:redistribution-and-revenue-are-one\]]{#des:redistribution-and-revenue-are-one label="des:redistribution-and-revenue-are-one"}

#### Congruence.

In addition to a well-functioning tax administration, tax collection also requires congruence between the economic activity being taxed and jurisdiction of taxation.
In @Oates1972' seminal formulation:

> *"The result of tax competition may well be a tendency toward less than efficient levels of output of local services.
> In an attempt to keep taxes lows to attract business investment, local officials may hold spending below those levels for which marginal benefits equal marginal cost, particularly for those programs that do not offer direct benefits to local business."*\
> --- @Oates1972 [143]
> [^129]

For example, when Pigouvian levies on pollution in aluminum production are set at the local level, but aluminum is widely traded, production will relocate to wherever taxes are lowest.
When factors and/or goods are sufficiently mobile, tax levels will race to the bottom.
This cooperation problem of taxation at the local level also applies to redistributive taxation where the rich will relocate to avoid progressive taxation.
Even fees for natural monopolies will be affected:
when sewage fees are set at the local level, other municipalities can attract more establishments by pricing their sewers at (initially much lower) marginal cost, rather than otherwise optimal average cost.
As more people and firms relocate to the cheaper municipality, it eventually becomes unable to provide the natural monopoly at marginal cost.

In the closed economy, tax competition is usually not a problem, as most taxes and vulnerable fees are set at the national level.
[^130]

#### (Many) More Tax Desiderata.

For general revenue and redistributive taxes, the list of desiderata goes on (see @Held2010a).
I focus here on only two criteria that are important for the welfare state and regional integration:
and (p. ).

##### Well-Determined Incidence on Natural Persons.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:well-determined-incidence\]]{#sec:well-determined-incidence label="sec:well-determined-incidence"}
In @Vickrey1947's seminal clarification, "genuinely progressive taxation is necessarily *personal* taxation" [-@Vickrey1947 1, emphasis added].
Albeit often ignored, this is merely a definitional clarification:
distributive norms only concern the relative utility of *natural persons*.
Corporations, for example, are no moral subjects, only people are.

Factually, corporations are also never the ultimate recipients of utility.
The welfare of all non-natural, private juristic persons (say, a public company) ultimately accrues to natural persons as their owners (say, shareholders), workers or customers.

Taxing a corporation --- as [cits]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="plural+short"} try to --- is as nonsensical as it is impossible.
It is nonsensical because we do not, and *cannot* know what it would *mean* to tax, say, the income of Deutsche Bank AG, because Deutsche Bank AG is an institutionalized fiction, but not a moral subject of fairness.
It is also impossible because taxing the income of Deutsche Bank AG *will* instead reduce the welfare of its owners, workers or customers (who *are* moral subjects).
Crucially, natural personhood is a condition *only* for general revenue and redistributive taxation, because they share the same *general* base (all people).
By contrast, pigouvian levies and fees *can* and *should* be levied on any merely formal market participants, including corporations, that use the respective common good or natural monopoly (a *specific* base).
While a [cit]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="singular+short"} on the income of Deutsche Bank AG makes no sense, the corporation should still be billed for its sewage or carbon footprint.

Not only will a nominal tax on the income of a corporation factually fall on its owners, workers and customers, but, to make matters worse, we cannot even know which of these stakeholders pays.
In the language of economics, the *effective* incidence of a tax can be difficult to ascertain, and it often matters little who nominally pays the tax as shown in (p. ).

\centering
![The Incidence of a Tax on Suppliers with Same Elasticities for Producers and Consumers[]{label="fig:same-incidence"}](same-incidence){#fig:same-incidence width="100%"}

Taxation is always an (p. ).
The incidence of a tax is borne by all parties to these market exchanges in proportion to their relative price elasticities of demand and supply, respectively, as shown in (p. ).
Whoever can cheaply exit or substitute the taxed market exchange dodges most of the tax:
because these price elastic suppliers *would* quickly cut their quantity supplied at lower prices, they can extract relatively high prices from buyers.
Buyers, in this example, cannot cheaply exit or substitute the taxed market exchange:
they *would* hardly be able to cut their quantity demanded in response to higher prices.
At the post-tax equilibrium, buyers foot most of the tax.

\centering
![The Incidence of a Tax on Suppliers with Relatively Less Elastic Demand[]{label="fig:different-incidence"}](different-incidence){#fig:different-incidence width="100%"}

In the real world, relative price elasticities of demand and supply in many markets are unknown and would be difficult to ascertain.
[^131]
Elasticity of demand and supply depends on many factors, including the availability of substitutes (for example,, margarine for butter) as well as the mobility and specificity of factors (for example, immobile, specific typewriter factory vs mobile, unspecific car rental).

Therefore, to fairly and effectively redistribute between natural persons, government must tax market interactions where the relative price elasticities of demand and supply can be easily known.
This is often the case for very broad categories of market exchanges, such as labor ([payroll]{acronym-label="payroll" acronym-form="singular+short"}) or consumption ([vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"}):
[^132]
people cannot substitute working *somewhere* or employing *someone*, they cannot avoid to buying or selling *something*.
[^133]
The price elasticities for demand and supply in these broadly defined markets are small and similar.

In the closed economy, government can effectively tax broad categories of market exchanges, such as consumption.
[^134]
By definition, economic activity does not extent beyond the borders of the closed economy, and there can therefore be no substitution to, for example, spending at home.

##### Minimal Market Distortions, Welfare Losses.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:minimal-DWL\]]{#sec:minimal-DWL label="sec:minimal-DWL"}
When government taxes a market exchange, buyers and sellers may react in ways that reduce overall welfare.

When the post-tax price of the transaction is higher than the buyers utility or the sellers cost, they exit the market.
Their otherwise pareto-improving exchange does not occur, as shown in (p. ).
Government also gains no revenue from these non-occurring transactions.
Everybody loses.
The sum total of these losses is known as the [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} of taxation (areas C, E in figure [)](fig:DWL).
An efficient tax minimizes [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} for maximum revenue (areas B, D).

\centering
![The [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} of a Tax with Unit-Elastic Supply and Demand[]{label="fig:DWL"}](dwl.pdf){#fig:DWL width="100%"}

This ratio of tax revenue to [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- much like the (p. ) --- depends on the price elasticities of supply and demand.
The more inelastic supply and demand, the smaller the [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} for any given tax rate, as shown in (p. ).
If buyers and sellers cannot easily cease their welfare-improving exchanges, they will continue to trade when taxed.
A tax on such a market will not distort or depress market activities.

\centering
![The Deadweight-Loss of a Tax with Inelastic Supply and Demand[]{label="fig:smaller-DWL"}](smaller-DWL){#fig:smaller-DWL width="100%"}

The price elasticities of demand and supply are, again, a hard, empirical question.
As discussed above, supply and demand in broad categories of market exchanges, such as all domestic consumption ([vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"}) or all domestic labor ([payroll]{acronym-label="payroll" acronym-form="singular+short"}) are relatively inelastic, and the [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} of such taxes is likely to be small in a closed economy.

Still, [dwls]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="plural+short"} of taxation may abound, even in closed economies.
In mixed economies, the market for low-wage labor is particularly vulnerable to large [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"}s.
Welfare state governments to people who earn too little to maintain a socially acceptable standard of living (p. ).

In this scenario, taxation of low-wage labor has two related, negative effects.
[^135]

1.  Taxation raises the effective cost of living for low-wage earners:
    for each euro they earn on the market, they can afford a lower, real standard of living.

2.  If people can apply for handouts, their supply of labor may become perfectly price elastic, when market incomes are close to welfare incomes.
    If they could earn less on the market, than by collecting welfare, low-wage workers may be forced to exit the labor market:
    a large [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} ensues.
    [^136]
    Any tax on low-wage labor will only increase the [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"}:
    for every euro of wages taxed, more people will be pushed outside the (official) labor market.
    [^137]

In the closed economy, government can minimize the tax burden on low-wage labor by relying more on progressive taxes, including a [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"}, instead of proportional taxes ([vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"}, [payroll]{acronym-label="payroll" acronym-form="singular+short"}).

The Means of Monetary Policy {#sec:monetary}
----------------------------

Government provides the economy with legal tender to serve as

a medium of exchange,

a unit of account and

a store of value.

Only government can do this, because supplying money is a (p. ).
To avoid the (p. ) and (p. ) of de- or inflation,
governments should be devoted to price stability.

They set that quantity of money where it equilibrates with variable money *demand* at stable prices.
The demand for money, in turn, is determined by the output of the economy.
[^138]

#### Tools.

Government extends or contracts the supply of money to meet a quantity, interest rate (US) or inflation rate (Bundesbank) target.
Fiat money is supplied in one of two ways:
[^139]

Government creates *base money* by

buying government bonds ([omo]{acronym-label="omo" acronym-form="singular+short"}) or

other financial assets ([qe]{acronym-label="qe" acronym-form="singular+short"}) from private holders who receive legal tender out of thin air
[^140]
in return.
[^141]
Central banks can also

lend money to financial institutions at a set rate (discount window rate).

Government stimulates the multiplication of *broad money* in the fractional reserve banking system by lowering the reserve requirements for private banks.

\centering
![The Policy Trilemma of Central Banks[]{label="fig:triangle-cb"}](triangle-cb){#fig:triangle-cb width="1\linewidth"}

#### Role.

The impact of monetary policy on the real economy is, of course, incompletely understood and highly controversial.
I do not need to recapitulate these controversies here (for a recent review, see @Wapshott2011).
I note two hopefully uncontroversial points:

1.  *Monetary Neutrality.*
    [\[itm:monetary-neutrality\]]{#itm:monetary-neutrality label="itm:monetary-neutrality"}
    Following the classical dichotomy, *nominal* economic variables, such as the price level, do not matter in the long run.
    The prosperity of an economy is determined by its level of technology, human capital and physical capital --- not by the amount of intrinsically worthless currency in circulation.

    On this ultimate end of monetary policy, Monetarists and Keynesians can probably agree:
    good money stays out of way of the real economy to let actual output track the long-term growth path of the economy.

2.  *An Empirical Question.*
    [\[itm:empirical-macroeconomics\]]{#itm:empirical-macroeconomics label="itm:empirical-macroeconomics"}
    Different monetary theories follow from different assumptions about human behavior:

    Keynesians

    :   believe that market participants are swayed by changes in nominal variables.
        As a result, the prices for goods and services and factor prices (especially wages) do not equilibrate promptly or perfectly.
        Self-reinforcing (debt-deflation) crises of excess supply and depressed demand may result [@Fisher1933].
        The state can smooth out resulting aggregate fluctuations in output by altering the money supply.

    Monetarists

    :   believe that market participants are fairly rational and will consider expectations of future inflation (and taxes) in their current decisions.
        As a result, prices for goods and services and factor prices, especially wages, equilibrate quickly and keep the economy on its long-term growth trajectory.
        State intervention in the business cycle or the money supply are unnecessary and ineffective.
        [^142]
        [^143]

    Determining our irrational *animal spirits* [@Keynes1936] is an empirical question best left to cognitive psychology, behavioral economics and related fields (recently @Akerlof2010, see , p. )
    "Keynes vs. Hayek" [@Wapshott2011] need not be a normative struggle, but a pragmatic balance based on empirical evidence.
    Whichever policy stabilizes economic output along the long-term growth trajectory is best.

    If ever there was a policy that should be judged on consequentialist terms, it is monetary policy.

Because monetary dynamics *do not* and *should not* matter to our 'household with a cast of billions' I can refer the issue to empirical clarification and need not entertain it further here.
Suffice it to remind us that government should set that quantity of money where it equilibrates with variable money demand at stable prices.
The rest is empirical details.

## Trade-Offs of the Mixed Economy 

Given its conflicting (p. ) the mixed economy can arrange its (p. ) to make at least two basic trade-offs.

1.  *Command vs. Exchange.*
    It can organize more or less production and distribution by command instead of exchange.

2.  *Consumption vs. Saving.*
    It can defer more or less of current consumption to the future.

We can look at these trade-offs by (p. ) and by (p. ) of the entire economy.

#### By Expenditure.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:by-expenditure\]]{#sec:by-expenditure label="sec:by-expenditure"}
A mixed economy can devote its resources (expenses) to public or private, investment and consumption goods.
The four expenditure components and revenue flows are plotted on a two-dimensional coordinate space of the mixed economy in (p. ).
I provide (very roughly) equivalent macroeconomic variables as in (p. ).
[^144]

![Coordinate Space of the Mixed Economy[]{label="fig:coordinate-space"}](coordinate-space){#fig:coordinate-space width="1\linewidth"}

\centering
##### Save/Consume More or Less.

Government increases the private savings rate by taxing consumption (instead of income), encouraging investment (factory) through industrial policy or other fiscal stimulus and increases public saving by putting net tax revenue into durable public goods (basic research), natural monopolies (a bridge) or .

Steering in the opposite direction, government increases private consumption by cash transfers, fiscal stimulus and public consumption by handing out in-kind benefits (school milk), or providing short-term public goods (fireworks) and natural monopolies.
The saving-consumption trade-off roughly expressed in the gross savings rate in (p. ).
[^145]

##### More or Less Government/Market

Government sets the exchange-command mix of the economy by taxing more or less of economic output, and commissioning public investment and consumption from the revenue.
The exchange-command mix is (roughly) expressed in the public expenditure quota in (p. ).

##### How to Strike the Best Balance.

Welfare economics and the of a mixed economy (p. ) suggests that there are one (or more) *optima* in the balance between saving and consumption, between market and command.
These ends also bind each of the government interventions, such as providing a public good, to *specific* justifications,
[^146]
such as a market failure in providing the public good.
Normatively, government *should* not take an arbitrary position on ().

However, I should point out that *positively*, government in a closed economy *could* employ its to choose any of the possible trade-offs between consumption and saving, market and command economy.

##### Tax is Key.

Of these of the mixed economy, tax is the dominant tool.
To redirect resources between the four quadrants, government relies primarily on (p. ) rather than on (p. ) which has limited applications and (p. ) which is neutral in the long run.

  : GDP Components by Expenditure in the Closed Economy[]{label="tab:GDP-Comp-Exp"}

#### By Changes in Net Worth

\phantomsection
[\[sec:delta-net-worth\]]{#sec:delta-net-worth label="sec:delta-net-worth"}
The same trade-offs of the mixed economy can also be understood as different changes in net worth.

As economies, firms and households save and consume, their net worth changes.
This truism is expressed in the Haig-Simons income identity:

$$\label{eq:haig-simons}
    \text{Income}=\text{Consumption}+\Delta\text{Wealth}$$

Or, trivially transformed:
$$\label{eq:haig-simons-trade-off}
    \text{Savings}-\text{Dissavings}=\text{Income}-\text{Consumption}$$

applies to the savings trade-off of households, firms and government, including some examples.

\centering
![Individual and Collective Haig-Simons Identity of Income[]{label="fig:haig-simons-individual-collective"}](haig-simons-individual-collective){#fig:haig-simons-individual-collective width="1\linewidth"}

The logic of the Haig-Simons identity, and is easy:
you can only have your cake *or* eat it.
Any change in consumption must be matched by a change in income or net worth --- and vice versa.

For instance, a household can afford to build a house either by taking out a mortgage, earning more, or consuming less.

The identity can be balanced *across* households, firms and government, too.
These transfers occur through different financial products and fiscal institutions.
For instance, a household can also afford to build a house if it pays fewer taxes and government accepts less revenue.
Government looses the amount in income that households earn.
[^148]

A comprehensive Haig-Simons identity also includes depreciation (for example, neglected roads) and depleted natural resources (for example, fossil carbohydrates) as real dissavings.
For instance, an economy can consume more than it earns for some time by burning oil.
[^149]
Conversely, a comprehensive Haig-Simons identity also includes real savings such as a newly developed technology or public infrastructure, even when these are not (yet) market priced.
[^150]
For instance, an economy can consume less today at equal income and channel the surplus into basic research, [rnd]{acronym-label="rnd" acronym-form="singular+short"} or send more people to (costly) college.

The Haig-Simons identity of income is a truism similar to the law of conservation of matter.
Surprisingly, it is often ignored or misconstrued, even in (p. ).

I offer two notes to further clarify:

1.  *Saving $=$ Investment.*
    In the long run, when industry has adapted and monetary effects have neutralized, all savings are invested.
    Saving does *not* depress aggregate demand and choke the economy.

    True Keynesian shortfalls in aggregate demand result from people hording *cash* or equivalents, and not because of an increase in investment.
    In deflationary spirals, anticipating lower prices, people cut *both* consumption *and* investment:
    the contracted money supply freezes up *all* economic activity.

    This popular conflation of monetary dynamics with savings rates may be one of the most formidable obstacles to enlightened, democratic choice of economic policies and tax in particular.
    [^151]

    Instead, saving *changes*, but need not depress, aggregate demand;
    more capital goods and fewer consumer goods are in demand.
    If given enough time, the economy can transform from "S-classes to school buildings" without write-downs on unamortized capital investment.
    Well-regulated, competitive financial intermediaries will always channel saving into investment.

    An investment is a valuable transformation or improved understanding of our physical world.
    It requires labor.
    Be it a [swf]{acronym-label="swf" acronym-form="singular+short"} or a savings account, a blast furnace or a green tech patent --- in the final analysis, saving always means to build more things that last longer and/or that we will consume later, instead of things that last a short while and that we consume now.

    Of course, any *one* investment will *ultimately* be consumed or depreciate away.
    And we *can* save too much, when capital goods depreciate faster and have such decreased marginal returns that they outstrip our current utility from the same resources (This follows from [@Solow1956] theory of growth, p. ).

    But while that means we should not save endless amounts at any point in time, it does not mean that at some point in time, we should save no more.
    There is no economic reason why we could not roll over (limited) savings to our children in perpetuity.

2.  *Dissaving $\neq$ Debt $=$ Deposits $\neq$ Saving.*
    [\[itm:credits-debits-wash\]]{#itm:credits-debits-wash label="itm:credits-debits-wash"}
    Dissavings are not the same as debt.
    Dissaving is a decrease in net worth of households, firms and economies:
    we diminish some durable thing in its value.
    Conversely, saving is an increase in net worth:
    we add value to some durable thing.

    In contrast, going into debt does not affect net worth of households, firms or government:
    we temporarily gain access to an *already existing* valuable thing (construction man-hours), potentially transform it into something else (a house) and return the valuable thing later (with interest).
    Conversely, putting in a deposit (or other credit) also does not affect net worth:
    we temporarily grant access to an *already existing* valuable thing to others, for an interest.

      : Debt and Credit in the Closed Economy[]{label="tab:Debt-Credit"}

    Trivially, public and private debt will always equal public and private credits in the closed economy as summarized in .
    By definition, every debtor needs a creditor.

    Debt and credit define the short-term control of and long-term claims to valuable things and may have distributive consequences, but they do not affect net worth.
    Net saving, by definition, does.

Smoke and Mirrors of the Mixed Economy

> *"If it's too good to be true, it's too good to be true."*\
> --- The author's landlady, trained nurse, single mother of three and foreclosed homeowner in Irvine, CA (2007)

A mixed economy can seemingly overcome its physical limitations and the (p. ) between different ends using a set of smoke and mirrors.

\centering
![Circular Flow of Income in the Economy, with Macroeconomic Imbalances](circular-flow-with-imbalances.pdf){width="100%"}

\scriptsize{Compare \autoref{fig:circular-flow-with-imbalances}.}
[\[fig:circular-flow-with-imbalances\]]{#fig:circular-flow-with-imbalances label="fig:circular-flow-with-imbalances"}

I briefly explain how three such practices allow us to live beyond our means in the short term:

1.  *Credit Bubbles.*
    [\[itm:credit-bubbles\]]{#itm:credit-bubbles label="itm:credit-bubbles"}
    Within the closed economy, (p. ).
    Still, excessive debt and credit can serve to hide or defer economic trouble ahead.

    In efficient financial markets, credit is extended to households, firms and governments at an interest rate that fully reflects the risk of default.
    To assess credit risk, creditors make (and update) predictions about the future solvency (and liquidity) of debtors.

    In the real world, these guesses are sometimes overly optimistic given the available information and credit is extended at too low an interest rate to too many people and organizations.
    [^153]
    As long as these risks are not reappraised or do not materialize, an economy can seemingly live beyond its material means.
    Eventually, of course, credit bubbles will burst and debtors will partly (have to) renege on their promises to repay interest and principal.
    Now, the economy as a whole has to pay for the fat years.

    Credit bubbles are thus always an intertemporal redistribution of wealth from the future to the presence.
    [^154]
    When they burst, credit bubbles also jumble ownership rights as defaults spread [@Stiglitz2010].
    [^155]
    Depending on this resulting, quintessential political-economic struggle between debtors and creditors, the brunt of the bursting bubble is allocated between different households, firms and government [@Coggan2011].
    [^156]
    Similar to inflation and asset bubbles, bursting credit bubbles also redistribute somewhat arbitrarily based on financial product and timing:
    people who own equity or leave overheated credit markets early enough, win.
    The suckers and laggards loose.

2.  *Asset Bubbles.*
    [\[itm:asset-bubbles\]]{#itm:asset-bubbles label="itm:asset-bubbles"}
    Concomitant to credit bubbles, bubbles can arise in certain classes of overvalued assets, often including real estate (2007ff), stock (2000f) but also art, oldtimers or essentially useless gold.
    Assets are overvalued, when their capital gains are more than what returns can reasonably be expected, given all available information.

    As long as prices do not revert to intrinsic value, people and the economy as a whole can live off the virtual capital gains and beyond its material means.

    Asset bubbles, too, redistribute wealth from the future to the presence.
    In addition, as pyramid schemes, they redistribute between early investors and later, "greater fools" (see @Stiglitz2010 for a good discussion of the 2007ff crises).

3.  *Inflationary Pressure.*
    [\[itm:inflationary-pressure\]]{#itm:inflationary-pressure label="itm:inflationary-pressure"}
    Excessive monetary expansion, aside from fueling credit and asset bubbles can also cause demand-pull inflation.
    The onset of inflation and its costs, however, need not be instantaneous.
    As upcoming wage-price spirals and increasing inflationary expectations silently add to built-in inflation [@Gordon1988], an economy may enjoy temporarily heightened output.
    [^157]
    As the price level eventually creeps up,
    [^158]
    the economy pays the costs of inflation through depressed growth.

    Grandfathered inflation also redistributes from the future to the presence, and arbitrarily redistributes between cash-denominated and other ownership claims, between debtors and creditors.
    [^159]

#### Too Good to be True.

In summary, an economy cannot produce and consume above its long-run growth path of outward shifting aggregate supply.

Trivially, the wealth of an economy is determined by its natural resources, technology, human and physical capital --- all *tangible things*.
When these capacities are fully utilized (as they are *not* in a cyclical downturn or debt-deflation crisis), no financial or monetary charlatanism can take us beyond them in the short term.
Any short-term gain that a bubble or excessive monetary expansion will bring only defers the day of this reckoning.


## Real Dissavings of the Mixed Economy {#sec:real-dissavings}

> *"Give me chastity and continence, but not yet."*\
> --- @St.AugusteofHippo397 Confessions (VIII, 7)

Our economies substantially dissave in ways that are not reflected in conventional macroeconomic data.
These *real* dissavings, or "off-budget fiscal activities" [@Bonker2006 49] include population aging,
[^160]
depleted natural resources (land, oil, water), exhausted common goods (global warming)
[^161]
or failed public goods (immunization?), to name just a few.

These processes all unambiguously degrade something of economic value, and should be recorded as consumption in our aggregate Haig-Simons accounts (as I have suggested in , p. ).

[^1]: [\[fn:tilly\]]{#fn:tilly label="fn:tilly"} This positive description does not imply normatively, as liberal entitlement theory would have it, "that a person is entitled to those goods acquired in uncoerced exchanges with others" [@Nozick1974; @Friedman1962 149].
    Uncoerced *exchange* does not mean absence of coersion.
    At the very least, markets rely on a large-scale coercive power (aka. the state) for property rights and states and markets [@Tilly-1985-aa].
    Naturalizing whatever allocative results the free market produces as entitled, inalienable, private property is as ahistorical as it is uncritical.

[^2]: Because I am interested in economic abstractions, a materialist theory of the state (such as @Tilly-1985-aa) suits me better than, for example, contract theories.
    Again, this does not imply positive or normative claims.

[^3]: I prefer the terms "market" and "command" economy, because the conventional *capital*ism-socialism dichotomy is misleading:
    real existing Soviet (especially Stalinist) socialism also accumulated capital (for example, electrification, railroads), just in different hands.
    Market exchange and planned command describe the different modes of production and distribution more precisely.

[^4]: Mixed economies also alter market outcomes to improve *efficiency* in case of market failures.

[^5]: Power resources theory [for example @Korpi2003], Marxist interpretations [for example @Offe1972] or recently, some advocates of a [big]{acronym-label="big" acronym-form="singular+short"} might disagree:
    for them, the purpose of the welfare state is to change power relations.
    These are reservations of the (p. ) and are discussed in (p. .

[^6]: Conversely, a socialist welfare state is an oxymoron.
    Just as welfare states are defined by their coexistence with a market economy, there is no such thing as a socialist welfare state, no matter the (however corrupted) distributional goals of nominal socialisms.
    In a predominantly planned, or even command economy, the state directs much of both production and distribution and therefore does not require the (welfare state) institutions governing the mixed economy, including taxation, insurance and pension funds, business cycle smoothing and dedicated social service provision.
    Even where these institutions nominally existed, they never faced the (otherwise defining) condition of independent market prices.
    For example, where "prices" are *set* and "profits" owned by the state, taxes become a meaningless category:
    they are really just changes in the set prices [for example, @Bonker2006 23].

[^7]: A misnomer.
    Even the [nhs]{acronym-label="nhs" acronym-form="singular+short"} is not fully socialized medicine, it is just a tax-financed near state monopsony on health services.

[^8]: In fact, social insurance contributions are a regressive

[^9]: Individual citizens are incentivized to mis(over)-represent their marginal utility from additional doctors, absent individually accruing costs.
    This is equivalent to a [cpr]{acronym-label="cpr" acronym-form="singular+short"} problem or the cooperation problem of a [pd]{acronym-label="pd" acronym-form="singular+short"}.

[^10]: ...or socialize parts of the labor market, which would further shift the frontier, but not alleviate the problem.

[^11]: ...as the etymology of economics would suggest:
    the science of managing the *oikos*, greek for household.

[^12]: [\[fn:also-in-mpp\]]{#fn:also-in-mpp label="fn:also-in-mpp"}
    This section is based, in part, on earlier, unpublished work which I submitted to the Hertie School of Governance as my Master of Public Policy thesis in [@Held2010a].
    I have since revised and expanded it.

[^13]: [\[fn:human-condition\]]{#fn:human-condition label="fn:human-condition"}
    I choose the term "human condition", because it captures what might be (positively) inescapable in human existence, without specifying either a natural or cultural explanation.

[^14]: Some of the frailties follow the heuristics and biases of human cognition identified by the prospect theory research program [@KahnemanTversky1979; @Kahneman2011]

    Prospect theory is appropriate to consider for any first-order theory on the material:
    it provides a positively descriptive model of human cognition and decision making as opposed to the normatively optimal (but rarely observed) expected utility hypothesis, on which neoclassical economics rest (first formulated by @Bernoulli1738, later specified by @VonNeumannMorgenstern1944).

    In part, the mixed economy and the welfare state (for example, mandatory pensions) are institutions to get prospect theory humans, easily mislead by their fast but erroneous "system one" to follow the slow, but accurate "system two" [@Kahneman2011]).
    Supposedly, when we give it some thought, we find that decisions based on expected utility [@Bernoulli1738] maximize our happiness, but ever the "cognitive misers" [@FiskeTaylor-1991-aa], exhausted and overwhelmed, we easily fall back to *system one* shortcuts and fail to rationally maximize utility.
    Institutions, characteristically enabling and restricting human behavior --- including those of the mixed economy --- can help prospect theory humans to approximate decisions based on expected utility.

    Prospect theory, alas, is still an emerging field (together with yet dejunct evolutionary psychology and cognitive neuroscience), and any link to the mixed economy must in the meantime remain tenuous.

[^15]: Indeed, as Dr. Mildner of the Hertie School of Governance never tired of telling me:
    "There is state failure, too"

[^16]: As suggested by the late [Kim-Jong Il's choice of grey jumpsuits](http://kimjongillookingatthings.tumblr.com/).

[^17]: As in modernization theory, for example, [@InglehartWelzel-2005-aa].

[^18]: Specifically, resource-based "rentier states" may hinder liberal democracy [@Beblawi1990].
    Generally, distributive decisions in planned economies appear easily as zero-sum games (as opposed to the per-definition non-zero-sum, pareto improvements in competitive markets), which may corrupt politics.

[^19]: This broad definition of efficiency is more demanding than pareto efficiency.

[^20]: Here, as always, it is important to keep up (p. ).
    The first theorem of welfare economics invoked here is an exercise in positive logic.
    It does not imply:

    1.  that *actual* markets display these properties --- that would be a first order *empirical*, not logical finding.
        The assumptions of are, in fact, quite heroic and may rarely be observed in the real world.

    2.  that market allocations are beyond normative reproach.
        The first theorem of welfare economics, crucially, operates only on *ex ante* distributions, which may or may not be distributively just.

[^21]: (Neo)classical economics takes an oddly static view of the economy.
    In reality, equilibria are more often in flux, a matter of becoming, not being.

[^22]: [\[fn:1st-theorem\]]{#fn:1st-theorem label="fn:1st-theorem"}
    Formally, the first theorem of welfare economics states that over a *given* distribution, the competitive equilibrium will be a pareto optimum (demonstrated first graphically by [@Lerner1944], mathematically by [@Lange1934], [@Debreu1954] and others).

[^23]: An allocation is pareto-improved if at least someone receives more, with others receiving (at least) the same.
    When all such improvements are exhausted, an allocation is pareto optimal.
    Crucially, pareto improvements and optimality are always in reference *only* to some ex-ante allocation.
    Also, pareto improvements do not imply that everyone would be better off by the same amount.

[^24]: Nassim Nicholas @Taleb2007 has recently put this succinctly by praising "aggressive trial and error" [-@Taleb2007 xxi] in free markets that "allow people to be lucky".
    Being a quantitative trader by profession, @Taleb2007 abandons rational choice when faulting Karl @Marx-1867-aa *and* Adam @Smith-1776-lq for believing that free markets work because of *rewards*.

[^25]: @Friedman1970a's dictum applies:
    "The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits" [-@Friedman1970a], both as commandment and promised salvation.

[^26]: This assumption is politically consequential.
    If firms and their owners, in fact, merely maximized their profits, their property would *not* bestow power.
    By definition, to be a profit-maximizer in a competitive market is to *only* do things that pareto-improve everyone over a given distribution.
    For property to bestow power in the classic definition [@Geoff2002 8ff], owners must sacrifice some of their profit to make other people do something they would *not* otherwise (pareto-optimally) have done.
    Under microeconomic dictum, owners exert power by *transferring* or *relinquishing* some of their surplus production.

    Clearly, to assume profit maximization and thereby to effectively define away a power aspect of property is implausible, and it rests on some heroic assumptions of human rationality and utility-maximization.
    More importantly, profit maximization implies --- as all such static microeconomics --- that future profits, and thereby, future demand *can* be known, at least probabilistically.
    From a more dynamic or evolutionary perspective, capitalism is *path dependent*, and those rich enough to bet on future profits now will make the very paths on which that future depends.

    Property *does* bestow power, and the kind of axiomatical contortions to define that away probably constitute the kind of hegemonic tendencies of microeconomic thinking that so (rightly) infuriates its critics.
    However, any emancipatory or equity argument on the distribution of property should explicate its relaxation of profit maximization, and provide some preliminary account of the motivations of rich people, instead.

    I take up this argument when I discuss the \[fairness of taxation\] (p. ), especially of a .

[^27]: Constant returns to scale contrast with the very idea of functional differentiation, economic modernization and division of labor discussed (p. ) and (p. ).

[^28]: I discuss only a popular subset of market failures in this paper.
    I ignore many of the problems recently highlighted by the 2007ff financial and sovereign debt crises.
    While common and public good failures explain much (for example herding and information spill-overs in @Banerjee-1992-aa), the 2007ff crises require a dedicated first-order theory of financial capitalism, including an in-depth appreciation of its institutions (for example, derivatives), practices (for example, bank equity) and policies (for example, interest rate).
    [@Cassidy2010] provides an equally accessible and comprehensive account of "How \[financial\] Markets Fail".

[^29]: Providing a public good has a positive externality, using a common good has a negative externality.
    Underproviding a public good and overusing a common good can also be represented as [pds]{acronym-label="pd" acronym-form="plural+short"}, where underprovision or overuse is the Nash Equilibrium.

    Whoever first buys a natural monopoly at very high marginal cost, extends the positive externality of very low marginal costs to all subsequent buyers.

[^30]: Elinor [@Ostrom1990] criticizes the canonically assumed failure of commons in social science and provides an empirically grounded account of their successful, non-coercive governing.

[^31]: Public and common goods are often hard to distinguish in public choice.
    *Not* overusing a common good is a public good, and providing a public good is a common good.

[^32]: This relaxes the perfect competition assumption [\[itm:easy-entry-exit\]](#itm:easy-entry-exit){reference-type="ref" reference="itm:easy-entry-exit"} on .

[^33]: Otherwise, if *all* buyers could pay for the initial costs equally.

[^34]: Calls for more startups, patents and research spin-offs, particularly in Germany, may serve as evidence for suboptimal incentive design under the status quo.

[^35]: [\[fn:monetary-commons\]]{#fn:monetary-commons label="fn:monetary-commons"}
    There are no monetary responses to any of these market failures, because (p. ) boosts or retards economic activity *overall* by extending or restricting credit and money creation.
    Markets fail in the provision of public goods, common goods and natural monopolies because these goods are ill-priced *relative* to other goods in the economy.
    States cannot deliberatively correct relative prices in the economy by monetary policy.

    Inflation, if and to the extent that it is caused by monetary overexpansion, may, however appear first in some goods, including long-term assets such as real estate, as appears to have happened in the US monetary expansion up until the 2007ff financial crisis.
    These relative price changes on the first impact of inflation cannot be effectively targeted by government and eventually propagate into an overall increase in price levels.

[^36]: The expression stems from Ireland, where the British king passed enclosure legislation to privatize and built fences around previously communal pastures.

[^37]: The Coase theorem further holds that it does not matter to whom the property rights are initially granted, say whether the polluters are granted a right to pollute, or citizens are granted a right to clean air (invariance thesis).
    While *welfare* neutral, this original granting of property rights does have distributive effects:
    whoever is granted the property right, enjoys a windfall.
    Economists often suggest to auction off new property rights at competitive prices, to minimize arbitrary distributive effects.

[^38]: Here's what happens upon privatization:
    Enclosed public goods become natural monopolies.
    Enclosed common goods become private goods, as per (p. .

[^39]: States can also regulate common goods by outlawing its overuse, as the US does by instituting minimum [cafe]{acronym-label="cafe" acronym-form="singular+short"} standards on automakers.
    Regulation by defining maximum acceptable use of commons is inefficient, because it does not incentivize market participants to save the commons wherever it is marginally cheapest to do so.
    Standards regulation cause a [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} much like minimum wages or other price floors and ceilings.

[^40]: The German term for a Pigouvian tax, helpfully, translates to "steering tax" (Lenkungssteuer).

[^41]: [\[fn:why-ac-fees\]]{#fn:why-ac-fees label="fn:why-ac-fees"}
    Recall that prohibitevely high initial marginal cost marred private markets in the first place.

[^42]: Except for (p. ).

[^43]: For two technical reasons, most economists and central banks prefer a positive, but moderate and stable rate of inflation of around 2% rather than perfect price stability at 0% inflation:

    1.  A positive inflation rate gives central banks room for maneuvre in fiscal stimulus.
        At moderate inflation, central banks can pursue a *negative* real interest rate (as was the case in 2011ff in many markets).

    2.  A positive inflation rate can mitigate the hypothesized downward stickiness of nominal labor costs.
        Real wages will fall even when nominal wages stay constant.

[^44]: The cost of minimizing cash holdings, including many trips to the bank, during which shoe leather is supposedly worn down.

[^45]: The costs of repricing for business, including the cost of changing restaurant menus.

[^46]: Experiencing higher consumer prices, workers will demand higher wages, which in turn prompts producers to increase sale prices.

[^47]: With the exception of Japan's lost decade.

[^48]: Under deflation, holding (increasingly valuable) cash is relatively more attractive than investing.

[^49]: This, if nothing else, is the reason why backing a paper currency with specie (such as the Gold standard) or pegging it to another currency (fixed exchange rate) are bad ideas:
    under such fixed or pegged regimes, the money supply expands and contracts *independent* of output.
    Under the gold standard, money supply tracks discovery and extraction of gold --- a process which is likely unrelated to economic output.
    This, in addition to the transaction costly lunacy of digging up gold in one place (a mine) only to bury it in another place (a vault).

    Similarly, under a pegged (or fixed) exchange rate, money supply follows the monetary command of *another* economy.

[^50]: I concentrate here on *individual* risk.
    Governments and markets should also reduce *aggregate* risk and systemic uncertainty [@Knight1921].
    They should avoid extreme negative risks, seek extreme positive risks [@Taleb2007] and avoid systems too complex and tightly coupled to be safely operated by humans [@Perrow-1999-aa].
    To the extent that such precaution, requires fiscal, regulatory or monetary policy intervention, this end also depends on intact of the mixed economy (p. ).

[^51]: If people were neutral between upside and downside risks, they would be indifferent between a lifetime of car insurance premiums and a (low) probability of accidental personal bankruptcy.

[^52]: With sophisticated financial markets, insurants buy this protection not just from one another, but also from other (rich) people or financial intermediaries willing to stomach the risk for a premium.

[^53]: I do not include old age here, because the risk component (a long life in retirement) of pensions is small compared to the saving component.
    Other insurances, notably health insurance, also include a saving component (for high morbidity in old age), but the risk component dominates.

[^54]: This relaxes perfect competition assumption [\[itm:perfect-information\]](#itm:perfect-information){reference-type="ref" reference="itm:perfect-information"} on .

[^55]: The conventional terminology stems from @Akerlof-1970-aa's original paper, in which he modelled quality uncertainty in the market for used cars.
    In American slang, a lemon is a car "that is found to be defective only after it has been bought" (Wikipedia).
    A cherry, conversely, is a good used car.

[^56]: Prior the Obama administration's [ppaca]{acronym-label="ppaca" acronym-form="singular+short"}, in the US, *pre-existing conditions* were frequently exempted from private health insurance contracts, defeating the purpose of insurance for many chronically ill or disabled persons.
    Private insurers minimize the ex-ante problem of asymmetric information by excluding those risks about which the insurants may already know.

    In Germany, insurants experience a similar frustration if they seek to take out (recently privatized) occupational disablement insurance, facing greatly limited coverage (for example, no cardio-vascular conditions), eligibility (for example, no back-related conditions for construction workers) or premiums (for example, higher rates for burnout-prone teachers).

[^57]: To the extent that government also regulates coverage and admittance, as it would have to do to avoid a lemons markets, the mandatory, nominally private insurance becomes a partly quasi-fiscal institution.
    When central qualities of the products (insurance) are regulated and buyers forced to buy, premiums are to a large extent pre-determined.
    Insurance firms will differ only in the few, administrative components of their business outside the reach of state command.
    The part of the premium that covers the mandated services is effectively a tax, and the insurance company but an outsourced service provider to the government.
    Ignoring, as I have here done, the (vexingly complicated) supply side of medical care, the difference between mandatory private and public health insurance appears small.

[^58]: Even people with a privately known risk of zero should be included, as low-risk insurants may otherwise find it attractive to misrepresent their privately known risks.
    This extreme case of a privately known risk of (close to) zero cannot be justified under an efficiency norm of Pareto optimality, as everyone is made better off by making some people worse off.
    Instead, it requires the stronger Kaldor-Hicks efficiency norm [@Kaldor1939; @Hicks1939].
    Resolving a lemons market may cost some people less than it will benefit others.
    
    <!-- %	The costs of risk pooling should incur generally to all entities, irrespective of their individually, asymmetrically known risk\footnote{Moral hazard, the ex-post problem of asymmetric information, is ignored \citep{Arrow1971}.

[^59]: Because (p. ).

[^60]: In perfect markets with sufficient price flexibility it also does not matter whether social contributions are levied from employers or employees.
    The incidence of a tax depends only on the relative price elasticity of supply and demand for labor.
    In labor markets, employees (supply) are typically less price elastic than employers (demand) who can substitute labor for capital, or move their capital.
    Employees end up paying for "social insurance" no matter the nominal burden.
    Only the matters (p. ).

[^61]: Again, states and markets are not the only way to organise production and distribution of material goods, emphatically not in the mainstays of moral hazard, such as decisions about medical care.
    [@Schwartz2010] argue passionately for a patient-doctor relationship based on trust and "Practical Wisdom" and cogently argue how *any* system based on incentives can, and *will* be perverted.

[^62]: According to [@Hobbes-1651-aa] "life in a state of nature" would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short".

[^63]: Whether a capacity for altruism really developed out of genetic nepotism, as both the book of genesis and the inclusive fitness hypothesis (@Hamilton1964 [@Wilson1975]) would have it has recently been questioned [@Wilson2012].

[^64]: This, again, is the first theorem of welfare economics (see footnote [\[fn:1st-theorem\]](#fn:1st-theorem){reference-type="ref" reference="fn:1st-theorem"}).

[^65]: This, of course, is the very exploitation that Marx has criticized (Manchester) capitalism for ([-@MarxEngels-1848-aa; -@Marx-1867-aa]).
    By definition, *proletarians* --- those who only have their offspring --- only receive the minimum wage necessary to reproduce themselves, and their labor.

[^66]: *Price discrimination* strategies are one often unacknowledged practice that redistributes utility from the rich to the poor in advanced market economies.
    To tap into different willingnesses to pay, firms often try to price same or similar goods to different market segments.
    Especially when the goods are same (toothpaste with or without coupon rebate), or similar in production cost (mid-priced sedan and luxury sedan), price discrimination can redistribute resources from (rich) consumers with a high willingness to pay to (poor) consumers with a lower willingness to pay --- an effective, if normatively imperfect way to redistribute.

    Compared to a no-trade scenario, price discrimination causes a pareto-improvement as per the (see footnote [\[fn:1st-theorem\]](#fn:1st-theorem){reference-type="ref" reference="fn:1st-theorem"}).
    Compared to a trade scenario *without* price discrimination, however, (poor) buyers with a low willingness to pay are better off compared to (rich) buyers with a high willingness to pay.
    With price discrimination, buyers of mid-priced sedans enjoy some of the innovations (airbags) first paid for by luxury car buyers.
    Pareto optimality makes everyone better off, but not by the same amount:
    a caveat that can have unexpected implications.
    If ever there was a way that wealth would "trickle down", this must be it.

    In addition to this unexpected distributive effect between consumers, much of price discrimination also constitutes monopolistic competition, and as such redistributes resources from consumers to producers and causes a [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"}.

[^67]: Consequently, some part of real observed structural unemployment may stem from such heightened wages, and therefore, be 'natural' [@Schlicht1978], as opposed to 'voluntary', as the Monetarists would have it.
    Keynesians may then conclude that an expanded money supply should continuously push against such natural, but suboptimal unemployment.

[^68]: By contrast, in perfect capital markets one investor with \$10 should be roughly replaceable by two investors with \$5 each, ignoring transaction costs, information asymmetries, risk aversion and other complications.
    High-skill labor markets may display invisibilities:
    one computer scientist with a PhD in artificial intelligence may not be replaceable by two (or more) computer scientists with an undergraduate degree in the same area.

[^69]: This relaxes assumption [\[itm:constant-returns-to-scale\]](#itm:constant-returns-to-scale){reference-type="ref" reference="itm:constant-returns-to-scale"} on .

[^70]: Such flexibility does justice to [@Baumol1965] original insight, which started out as an empirical observation on the relative pay of the performing arts, and not as an(other) *iron* law of wages (cf. @Malthus1798).

[^71]: These additional, scarce opportunities may be awarded to individuals (or firms, or regions) based on easy but imperfect measures (for example, standardized test scores).
    They may also be awarded based on probabilistic predictions on future performance (think past awards), further increasing a self-reinforcing dynamic.
    In the worst, most inequitable (and inefficient case), they are awarded based on meaningless, randomly occurring differences (for example, mental state on day of testing), haphazard selections (for example, first come, first serve) or systematic measurement bias (for example, habitus expectations by assessors).

[^72]: This relaxes assumption [\[itm:easy-entry-exit\]](#itm:easy-entry-exit){reference-type="ref" reference="itm:easy-entry-exit"} on .

[^73]: Such as job opportunities on professional networks [@Benkler2006], the marks of social distinction received at the dinner table (@Bourdieu-1984-aa, recently @Hartmann2002), academic peer citations [@Jackson1968; @Merton1988], or plain social influence [@Asch].

[^74]: This is precisely the kind of critique from which the first theorem of welfare economics is rightly immune:
    it assumes *given distributions* and it --- as pareto optimality in general --- have nothing to say about the virtue or vice of these original allocations.
    This is, however, the kind of critique that must be waged against any neoclassical, or otherwise account that swiftly jumps from formal logic to normative judgement to policy implication without taking due note of these limitations.

[^75]: Marginal utility diminishes, but does not turn negative.
    Consequently, the rich will still enjoy greater utility, if only slightly more.

[^76]: The canonical version can be found in (p. .

[^77]: When positional consumption is a pure [pd]{acronym-label="pd" acronym-form="singular+short"} cooperation problem, it becomes not just inequitable, but inefficient, too.
    When defection (buying BMWs) is widespread, curbing positional consumption is even .
    Economist [Robert H. Frank](http://www.robert-h-frank.com) has long ([-@Frank1987]) argued provocatively that positional taxation may benefit the rich and recently testified for a [pct]{acronym-label="pct" acronym-form="singular+short"} in front of the US [House Financial Services Committee](http://financialservices.house.gov/) on May 16, 2007.

[^78]: This violates the assumption [\[itm:infinite-buyers-sellers\]](#itm:infinite-buyers-sellers){reference-type="ref" reference="itm:infinite-buyers-sellers"} of .

[^79]: Historically, at least, public companies (the Dutch East India Company in 1602) and banks (Venice-based Medici bank in 1397) predated capitalism, and to this day, [ifis]{acronym-label="ifi" acronym-form="plural+short"} urge nascent "capitalisms" to legislate corporate law and build financial intermediaries.

[^80]: Rent control is famously derided as "the next best way to destroy a city" aside from carpet bombing.

[^81]: In addition to the mere complexity of such regulatory intervention, price controls are also prone to rent-seeking clients.
    As the gains (and losses) will often be obvious to, and concentrated in some citizens, they may lobby their government to affect changes [@Peltzman1976; @Posner1975; @Krueger1974].
    As in oil-rich rentier states [@Beblawi1990], widespread zero-sum games may corrupt politics.

[^82]: Such as in Article 9, Section 3 of the German Basic Law.

[^83]: A cash-flow based, post-paid [pct]{acronym-label="pct" acronym-form="singular+short"} (recently @McCaffery2002 [@McCaffery2005]), a [lvt]{acronym-label="lvt" acronym-form="singular+short"} [@George1879], and, if necessary, a [nit]{acronym-label="nit" acronym-form="singular+short"} to fight structural unemployment or working poverty (first suggested by Milton @Friedman1962), and a [wt]{acronym-label="wt" acronym-form="singular+short"} on net worth to rein in extreme inequity are to respond to these inequities (p. ).

    Notably, even such sharply progressive taxation, may be unable to mitigate the inequities (and welfare losses) of monopsony employer labor markets.
    Potentially, monopsony employers will counteract progressive schedules by further lowering their wages.
    Some regulatory interventions, especially a right to strike and to unionize, may be essential.

[^84]: Rich people are more likely to be creditors, and poor people more likely to be debtors.
    Telling, as [@Coggan2011] does, the history of mankind as the struggle between debtors and creditors [paraphrasing @Marx-1867-aa] may be roughly adequate and enlightening, but the simplification carries only so far.
    As [@Coggan2011 K6-24-04] himself points out, German hyperinflation wiped out the (often nominally denominated) savings of the middle class, but left relatively unaffected the (often real denominated) wealth of the upper class and the subsisting lower class with neither debt nor savings.

[^85]: There is a case to be made for deliberately sharing the burden of systemic and unsustainably high levels of debt, as may be case with Greek sovereign debt in the 2007ff financial crisis [@Coggan2011].
    As @Coggan2011 reminds us, we do not need inflation to achieve that;
    a (partial) default will do the trick, colloquially referred to as a "haircut" in the 2007ff financial crisis.

[^86]: [\[fn:3components\]]{#fn:3components label="fn:3components"}
    In his treatise on the economic costs of global warming, @Stern-2006-aa lists three components to discount to future utility:

    future people may value an additional unit of consumption less (or more) if they have more (or less) output available overall (elasticity of marginal utility).

    expected but *exogenous* growth, such as a chance discovery of a new technology, may increase future output without requiring present people to give up anything.

    people will discount future utility simply because it is in the future and uncertain (the pure discount rate of the future) [@Stern-2006-aa 52].

[^87]: Idiosyncratic risk of specific investments are diversified or hedged away.
    Risk-free interest rates still include a premium for *systematic* (not systemic) or aggregate risk, such as the continued existence of life on earth.
    The remaining interest component, the pure discounting of future utility, represents the hedonic loss of present, myopic individuals.

[^88]: Specifically, saving (below @Solow1956's optimal rate) without interest is a @Kaldor1939-@Hicks1939 improvement:
    future utility is greater than present cost.
    Interest can be considered an intertemporal sidepayment from the future to the present.
    With interest, sub-optimal level saving can be pareto improved:
    upon saving more, both present and future generations (and selves) are at least equally well off.

[^89]: Myopia implies a *shift* in the supply curve of saving.
    For any given interest rate, people will supply less.

[^90]: *Endogenous* business cycle durations range from 3--5 years for lagged inventory decisions [@Kitchin1923], 7--11 for fixed investment [@Juglar1862], 15--25 for infrastructural investment [@Kuznets1930] and 45-60 for technological revolutions [@Kondratiev1925].

    For a recent empirical test of all four business cycle theories, see [@Korotayev2010].

    The latter two of these are probably beyond reliable anticipation and certainly beyond the short-term.
    They are also contested as empirical artifacts [@Howrey1968] or restricted to heterodox, evolutionary economics [@Modelski2010].

[^91]: [rbct]{acronym-label="rbct" acronym-form="singular+short"} proponents consequently argue against state interventions to counteract these exogenous shocks.

[^92]: For a fully-fledged account, involving the debt, equity and asset market as well as monetary and regulatory correlates of *Maniacs, Panics and Crashes*, see [@KindlebergerAliber-2005-aa].
    Herding has also been complemented and expanded into the (heterodox) debt-deflation theory of economic cycles, where credit cycles magnify initial bubbles, panics or shocks [@Fisher1933].

[^93]: Generous lay-off protection has been hypothesized to contribute to "eurosclerosis".

[^94]: According to the opposing, now minority view of [ret]{acronym-label="ret" acronym-form="singular+short"}, fiscal expansion will be ineffective, because market participants will correctly anticipate that current deficit spending (expansion) will be offset by future tax hikes (contraction).
    Anticipating such future losses, they will hoard more cash and equivalents today, than they would otherwise, thereby negating any current period effect.

    Even though controlled experiments are not readily available at the level of entire economies, deficit spending seems to work, at least a little.
    Here, for once, human ignorance (of [ret]{acronym-label="ret" acronym-form="singular+short"}) is not only bliss, but also a blessing for all of us.

[^95]: A democratic polity can public for private demand as it wishes (p. ), but any such balance will not affect aggregate (public *and* private) demand.
    Democracies can call this shot, but it will not alleviate slumps.

[^96]: The 2009 German *cash-for-clunkers* scheme --- for all its infamous waste, cannibalizing effects and blatant clientelism --- included such an incentive:
    car buyers had to top-up the subsidy with own savings to buy a new car.

[^97]: To the extent that it serves as an automatic stabilizer and/or pools the near-universal risk of unemployment, "unemployment insurance" is, again, a misnomer.
    The demand stabilization bought by unemployment benefits are a public good, idiosyncratically financed out of a specific tax in many countries.

[^98]: (German) automatic stabilizers have recently faired well during the 2007ff financial crisis and received great praise by [ifis]{acronym-label="ifi" acronym-form="plural+short"} (@IMF-2008-ab [20], @WorldBank2008 [19]) and experts [@BofingerFranz-2007-aa 8].

[^104]: When understood endogenously, strata of underqualified workers are also a real (if not nominal) dissaving in human capital.
    Saving, then, means to (publicly) educate most everyone to be competitively productive in a skill-based economy that outsources or offshores much of manual labor.

[^105]: It does not matter for the economy-wide savings rate whether citizens save into privately offered financial products or state-guaranteed (often [paygo]{acronym-label="paygo" acronym-form="singular+short"}) schemes.

    Specialization pays, because marginal costs of production fall (positive returns to scale).
    Clustering pays, because network effects (such as in the transmission of innovation, according to @Bass1969) reward and reinforce tightly-nit networks (technically a group of nodes with some degree of heightened interconnectedness).
    For a brilliant introduction to network theory, see [@Kleinberg-2009-oz].

[^113]: Such divergence between *formal* and *real* factor mobility and market flexibility is crucial not only to trade theory, but also economic policy making.
    I return to this issue when I discuss the theory of (p. ).

[^114]: German reunification provides a realistic example for this scenario.
    Eastern workers were less productive than their western compatriots, but soon expected to be paid equally.
    Arguably, labor costs in the East and the West converged too far and too soon causing structural unemployment.

[^115]: This does not contradict a (p. ).
    Trade unions --- supply cartels by another name --- are justified if and to the extent that they help to *balance* the playing field between (monopsony) employers and atomized workers.
    By definition, unemployment suggests that the field has tilted too far:
    there are surplus workers that cannot find a willing employer at the price imposed by the supply cartel.
    Unemployment resulting from wage rigidity is the welfare loss equivalent to the reduced output of a monopoly provider.

    Recognizing a level playing field in the real world will be very difficult.
    Employers will always (and sometimes truthfully) argue that they would hire more workers, if only the wages were lower.
    Unions will always (and sometines truthfully) argue that employers could pay more without laying off workers.

[^116]: I use the term more narrowly and do not, as others, include market failures or protection.
    are adressed by government to improve (p. , not to improve convergence.
    Protection, such as [isi]{acronym-label="isi" acronym-form="singular+short"} is not available within the closed economy.

    By industrial policy, I here mean the discretionary and deliberative intervention in the economy by government, maybe best captured in the french term "gouvernement economique".

[^117]: The failure of bank regulation in the run-up to the 2007ff financial crisis has recently shown that government is easily ill-equipped to prevail in this "cat-and-mouse-game".

[^121]: This is a hypothetical and admittedly implausible example.
    There may be other compelling reasons to legislate health and safety, at the national level, for hairdressers, too, including fairness and simplicity.

[^122]: Nominal base, sadly, differs from the effective (p. ).

[^123]: As I explained in , the economy-wide savings rate is a commons, too.
    A pigouvian levy on dissaving such as a [pct]{acronym-label="pct" acronym-form="singular+short"} internalizes the social cost of consuming over the government-set optimal savings rate [@Held2010a].

[^124]: One might think that a redistributive tax is *specific* in base, but that is a misunderstanding.
    Redistribution favors some, and disfavors others, but it always affects *all* people somehow.

    Indeed, a *specific* redistributive tax would be a contradiction in terms:
    redistributing only between some entities in turn constitutes a redistribution between the included and the exempted entities.

    Moreover, specific inclusion or exemption of entities based on something other than the accepted equity norm (for example, ability to pay) conflicts with liberal-democratic norms of non-discrimination

[^125]: Even entities with a privately known risk of zero should be included, as low-risk entities may otherwise find it attractive to misrepresent their privately known risks.
    This extreme case of a privately known risk of (close to) zero cannot be justified under an efficiency norm of , as everyone is made better off by making some entities worse off.
    Instead, it requires the stronger norm (p. )[@Kaldor1939; @Hicks1939].
    Resolving a lemons market will cost some people less than it will benefit others.

[^126]: Even those who receive *no* utility from the public good should pay, both because their non-utilizing cannot be observed (non-exclusion) and because any additional utilization does not create costs (non-rivalry).
    This case of little or no utility from public good again requires , not [@Kaldor1939; @Hicks1939].

[^127]: Fiscal stimulus occurs only government spending *exceeds* tax revenue in bad times.
    Resulting debt has to be paid back in good times with increased tax receipts.

[^128]: Confusion, alas, *is* everywhere.

    For example, a [ftt]{acronym-label="ftt" acronym-form="singular+short"} was frequently touted by the left to pay back sovereign debt, or to redistribute between rich and poor.
    However, a [ftt]{acronym-label="ftt" acronym-form="singular+short"}, as originally conceived by [@Tobin1970], is a *Pigouvian levy*, meant to disincentivize short-term trading.

    Accordingly, it should be judged on *those* merits, and on those *only*:
    can it curb the commons of "speculation", or, more precisely beauty-contest [@Keynes1936] herding [@Banerjee-1992-aa]?

    Whether or not a [ftt]{acronym-label="ftt" acronym-form="singular+short"} is, in fact, able to also raise revenue, let alone *redistribute* according to some norm of fairness is dubious, at best.
    Traders may be able to push the additional cost of a [ftt]{acronym-label="ftt" acronym-form="singular+short"} down their customers, including small-time bank customers.

    For a Pigouvian levy, this is a good sign:
    the price signal of an exhausted commons *should* perculate through the entire economy.
    For a *redistributive* tax, however, such dubious incidence is arbitrary:
    redistributive taxes must fall only on those intended by legislators.

[^129]: Political economists such as [@Dehejia1999] have recently added more nuance to the spectre of tax competition.
    It might, for example, not quite lead to the bottom, as attracted investment also has diminishing returns [-@Dehejia1999 416], and may further favor smaller economies more than larger ones, where the ratio between attracted investment and foregone public spending is higher.

    For a succinct overview of tax competition theories, also see [@Wilson1999].

[^130]: The German [lbt]{acronym-label="lbt" acronym-form="singular+short"} is a sad exception.
    While it is ostensibly meant to raise general, not specific revenue for municipalities, it is set by local government.
    Predictably, many municipalities find themselves forced to lower [lbt]{acronym-label="lbt" acronym-form="singular+short"} rates.

[^131]: It is usually assumed that incidence applies only to *indirect* taxes such as [vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"} and [cit]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="singular+short"}.
    I find this limited application of incidence implausible.
    The concept remains applicable for *direct* taxes, including [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} and [wt]{acronym-label="wt" acronym-form="singular+short"}, too.

    A [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} on labor incomes, for instance, may partially fall on employers when labor markets are very tight:
    tax-depressed worker supply may cause employers to pay more.
    Even a [wt]{acronym-label="wt" acronym-form="singular+short"} may fall on people other than the owners when demand for their collateral is sufficiently inelastic:
    interest rates may rise when private capital becomes less abundant.

[^132]: A proportional [payroll]{acronym-label="payroll" acronym-form="singular+short"} is actually equivalent to a [vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"} in its incidence.
    A [payroll]{acronym-label="payroll" acronym-form="singular+short"} taxes (only) labor income before it is spent (prepaid), a [vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"} taxes (only) labor income after it is spent (postpaid).

[^133]: Saving is a third alternative if you subscribe to a *[y2c]{acronym-label="y2c" acronym-form="singular+short"}*:
    when you consider returns on capital a genuine *change* in welfare, you can substitute present spending for *more* future spending.

    If, instead, you believe in a *[osn]{acronym-label="osn" acronym-form="singular+short"}*, returns on capital are just compensation to risk, uncertainty and delayed pleasure:
    welfare is *postponed*, but not changed.
    Consequently, under a [osn]{acronym-label="osn" acronym-form="singular+short"}, you can only substitute current consumption for same future consumption, and have no alternative but to spend your money at some point.

    For a summary of the savings norm debate see [@Held2010a] or, in the brilliant original, [@McCaffery2005 819].

[^134]: I use consumption and, broadly equivalently, labor as examples here because unlike income taxation ([pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"}), they do not require me to decide on a savings norm ([y2c]{acronym-label="y2c" acronym-form="singular+short"} or [osn]{acronym-label="osn" acronym-form="singular+short"}).
    Both norms are unattractive in the extremes and only a [pct]{acronym-label="pct" acronym-form="singular+short"} can resolve the tension (@Held2010a).

    Still, it is important to point out that, no matter the savings norm, savers in a closed economy have limited or no alternative to investing at home.
    Therefore, the incidence of a [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} will also be relatively well-defined in a closed economy.

[^135]: As explained in the above, both a [payroll]{acronym-label="payroll" acronym-form="singular+short"} and a [vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"} burden low-wage labor.

[^136]: In this extreme, unlikely case, the [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} of a welfare handout is equivalent to the [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} of a price floor on labor at the same level.

[^137]: People leaving the labor market in this scenario has nothing to do with laziness.
    The legislated minimum standard of living is after all considered minimally acceptable.
    People who opt for welfare instead of poorly paid work may not have a choice.

[^138]: This very brief account follows the *quantity* theory of money.
    Competing theories are discussed in the below.

[^139]: If for no other reason, fiat money would be preferable to intrinsically valuable moneys *because* governments can adjust its supply to output in the long run and at little cost.
    By contrast, specie moneys are costly to extract and their supply changes arbitarily on new discovery.

    The futility of a gold-based economy is aptly summarized by investor Warren Buffett:

    > *"\[Gold\] gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace.
    > Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it.
    > (...)
    > Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head."*\
    > --- Warren Buffett

[^140]: Actually, the balance sheet of the central bank records the acquired bond as an asset, and the currency as a liability.

[^141]: Central banks are customarily barred from buying government bonds directly from government to increase transparency.
    By buying government bonds from a middlewoman, central banks can still "print money".

[^142]: They are unnecessary according to .

[^143]: They are ineffective according to the policy ineffectiveness proposition.

[^144]: [gdp]{acronym-label="gdp" acronym-form="singular+short"} and its macroeconomic components, while commonly reported, falls short of a comprehensive account of the economy.

    Rather than a measure of prosperity, it indicates market value level of economic *activity*.
    Roughly, [gdp]{acronym-label="gdp" acronym-form="singular+short"} is to prosperity, as a corporation's cash flow statement is to its income statement.
    [gdp]{acronym-label="gdp" acronym-form="singular+short"} growth and positive cash flows are a necessary, but not a sufficient condition to prosperity.

    [gdp]{acronym-label="gdp" acronym-form="singular+short"} does not measure changes in net worth as an income statement would:
    for example, an earthquake (or nuclear power disaster, or both) can raise [gdp]{acronym-label="gdp" acronym-form="singular+short"} because of reconstruction *activities*, even if it actually wiped out *assets*.
    [gdp]{acronym-label="gdp" acronym-form="singular+short"} also excludes environmental degredation or use of natural resources.

    Lastly, [gdp]{acronym-label="gdp" acronym-form="singular+short"} falls short, because it records only activity with a market value;
    economic activity in the household or family are not included, as are social costs or utility of market activities (externalities).

[^145]: GDP-related metrics fall short, again:
    [gfcf]{acronym-label="gfcf" acronym-form="singular+short"} and consequently the gross savings rate does not include capital depreciation.
    It also does not include real dissavings on goods without a market value, such as the population growth rate or environmental quality.

    Consequently, gross savings rates may be overstated in existing accounts.

[^146]: Justifying a choice of the mixed economy does not mean that it can be reduced to a positive question.
    Ends and means such as redistribution may, and maybe should, remain contested.

[^147]: [gdp]{acronym-label="gdp" acronym-form="singular+short"} also does not, as implied in distinguish between public consumption and public investment, but lumps both together in [G]{acronym-label="G" acronym-form="singular+short"}.

[^148]: Strictly speaking, this would be the case only for a perfect tax with a zero [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"}.

[^149]: Arguably, the past two centuries of growth in the West are to some extent due to the exploitation of fossil fuels.

[^150]: Preparing a Haig-Simons account on illiquid, public or intangible assets will be difficult.
    As far as possible, accounting should rely on market prices, but will also have to rely on some planned [cba]{acronym-label="cba" acronym-form="singular+short"}.

[^151]: In my ongoing dissertation at [bigsss]{acronym-label="bigsss" acronym-form="singular+short"} on the pluralist and deliberative politics of taxation, I call this misunderstanding *Bastard Keynesianism*, gone badly awry.
    I hypothesize that because people do not properly understand the Haig-Simons identity (and the economic cycle), they will erroneously assume that any tax on consumption will hurt the economy.
    In truth, as I argue here, an economy can take on any trade-off between present and future consumption, if only it is phased in slowly enough.

    This confusion, I argue, diverts people away from optimal and fair taxation and effectively curtails the democratic sovereign in pluralism.

[^152]: This distinction seems straightforward.
    Yet, similar to bastard Keynesianism, much of public debate of finance and economicsis is marred by great confusion about these basic terms.
    @McCaffery2005 explains how an inconsistent treatment of debt and capital gains opens up income taxation to "tax evasion 101".

[^153]: Credit and concomitant asset bubbles can arise for several reasons and according to competing theories, including beauty-contest-type [@Keynes1936], herding [@Banerjee-1992-aa] and excessive monetary expansion [@Stiglitz2010].
    An authoritative history of financial crises is [@KindlebergerAliber-2005-aa].

[^154]: Conversely, credit crunches, in part, redistribute wealth from presence to the future.
    By keeping the economy below its potential aggregate supply, credit crunches also waste capacity

[^155]: Conventionally, as @Stiglitz2010 points out, a default wipes out shareholders (equity finance) and makes creditors (debt finance) into the new shareholders.
    In the 2007ff financial crises, as elsewhen, economic and political power often intervened to distribute the pain of default differently [@Stiglitz2010].

[^156]: @Coggan2011 recently told the history of all hitherto existing society as the struggle between debtors and creditors, to paraphrase [@MarxEngels-1848-aa].
    According to both @Coggan2011 and [@Stiglitz2010], household debtors and governments assumed much of the burden during the 2007ff financial crises, causing, in part, the pursuant sovereign debt crises.

[^157]: Traditionally described as an (inward) move along the [@Phillips1958] curve.

[^158]: An upward shift of the [@Phillips1958] curve.

[^159]: In addition, the costs of later disinflation may be large.
    Prescriptions for disinflation and expected costs differ.

Kato 2003 as cited in ibid 1064: yes, a revenue shift to regressive taxes makes it politically easier to maintain a large public sector (51) but that is a bad idea, it's not the idea of a welfare state

## Ganghof 2004

scharpf in foreword 12 cites the negative employment effects of high social contributions, also inequitable because they're strictly proportional
also in scharpf foreword 13: MwST does 2 bad things: it depresses the price-elastic demand for low-qualification service industry jobs (which is very bad) and it raises the costs of living for everyone.
Scharpf is right when he says there is much to explain about the chaos of german tax. In fact, there is MUCH more to be explained if you look at a perfect counterfactual.
19 CIT and PIT highest marginal rates are same in Germany since 1977 (and for a  good reason)
25 make this key point: when Ganghof suggests a dual income tax for germany, fundamental equity (OR efficiency) concerns are long past. 25. He cites two "pragmatic reasons" 1) it will be easier to find a cap income tax rate that is low enough to include as many as possible kinds of cap income. 2) labor incomes can still be taxed progressively.
wow, where's the innovation?

## Genschel 2004

the sceptics and the revisionists have it wrong: because they lack the right counterfactual 616
the welfare state is indeed, and rightly so, expected to do 2 things as Genschel 617 writes (this is part of the two criterion)
to systematically control economic developments at the macro-level (macro-economic control), and
to guarantee, unconditionally, adequate living standards at the micro-level (redistributive social policy)

note that really depreciation isn't all that difficult: we do that for firms, too and we do it fairly roughly. We can do that for households, too. Also: if people sell their stuff at some point, we may even allow them to correct for the depreciation up or downwards. -->


<!-- %Developed welfare states are faced with a twin crisis of fiscal configuration that is mutually reinforcing:
%one of structural unemployment, and one of structural underfunding.

%Structural unemployment is caused by effective price floors for labor, at or below the socially acceptable minimum income in a society, but above the labor productivities of a segment of the working population.

%Structural underfunding is caused by a state that is increasingly unable to raise sufficient revenues necessary for the provision of public and common goods, as well as to finance its redistributive needs.
%The result of the two crises is an economy with forgone productive capacity and suboptimal, collective net investments in the face of greater challenges.

%\subsection{Boundary Conditions}
%Three boundary conditions exacerbate the situation.

%\paragraph{Aging} One is the aging (and later, shrinking) of the population of most developed welfare states (\marginpar{\textsf{reference and expand on second demographic transformation literature here, include empirical findings})}.
%Below replacement level ($\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total-fertility-rate}{tfr}<2.1$) fertility rates curtail future growth.
%Worsening dependency ratios require ever more resources to be consumed.
%
%Aging is, in effect, a loan on future generations, taken out already:
%even if fertility rates would return to above replacement level today, demographic dynamics would take decades to recover.
%Interest and principal on this loan are usually not included in calculations of net private saving or public investment \marginpar{\textsf{(reference)}}, but the pinch is starting to be felt \marginpar{\textsf{(reference)}}.
%
%\paragraph{Changing Factor Returns} Under international trade and capital mobility, not only the allocation of factors --- in idealized form, a Ricardian division of labor --- but also the factor \emph{returns} change.
%According to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, the relatively abundant factor in an open economy becomes more expensive vis-\`a-vis a relatively scarce, cheaper factor (as cited in\cite{KrugmanObstfeld-2007-aa}) \marginpar{\textsf{(need to dig deeper into this, read more, elaborate, provide empirical support)}}.
%
%This effect is commonly known as a the de-industrialization of the west, where, under trade and/or capital mobility, the OECD-world specializes on (human) capital-intensive production, and labor-intensive production is rendered largely obsolete.
%Where it persists --- for example in the service sector --- it creates only low returns, when compared to autarky.
%
%\paragraph{Imperfectly Governed International Political Economy} The second boundary condition is a liberalized, but only imperfectly governed international political economy.
%Factors of production, chiefly capital, are highly mobile and have through competitive pressure curtailed, if not diminished, the ability of states to redirect resources through taxation \marginpar{\textsf{(cite preliminary references here, reformulate as hypothesis)}}.
%No international regime for effective cooperation in the field of tax policy has arisen yet, to supersede or replace now impaired national polities.
%
%\subsection{Deficient Policy Responses}
%Under the given boundary conditions, developed welfare states have chosen suboptimal policies that brought about the twin crisis of structural unemployment and structural underfunding.
%Policy responses have been likewise deficient.
%
%\subsubsection{Structural Unemployment}
%\paragraph{Low Productivity $+$ Price Floors $=$ Structural Unemployment} States have created and exacerbated structural unemployment by raising effective price floors for labor, by means of statutory minimum wages or decommodifying social transfers.
%Means-tested welfare reform and benefit cuts in the last three decades notwithstanding, states have failed to harness completely the low-productivity strata of the labor force, at socially acceptable incomes \marginpar{\textsf{(reference)}}.
%
%Incomes and employment of low-productivity workers often appear to be in a zero-sum relationship \marginpar{\textsf{(elaborate, and reference)}}.
%
%\paragraph{Underinvestment in Education}In a similar (and related) case of loaning resources from the future as in the case of below-replacement fertility, many family policy regimes and education systems fail to equip new generations with the necessary skills to be sufficiently productive to maintain, let alone enhance living standards \marginpar{\textsf{(empirical reference)}}.
%The underinvestment in education has to be understood against the backdrop of the above-mentioned changing factor returns, where only (human) capital-intensive production yields socially acceptable incomes.
%
%\paragraph{A Grim Outlook}Future labor markets await ever smaller cohorts with a large share of inadequately qualified workers, destined to become transfer recipients and, under current policies, unemployed.
%Destined to be decommodified --- rendered useless, in fact.
%
%\subsubsection{Structural Underfunding}
%
%\paragraph{Increasing Expenditure $+$ Tax Competition $=$ Structural Underfunding} Structural underfunding came about as the net result of increasing expenditure requirements and downward pressures for taxes on increasingly mobile factors of production, chiefly capital.
%
%\paragraph{A Regressive Shift Towards Immobile Bases} Taxation, as a result, has shifted to immobile bases, towards consumption and labor.
%Consumption taxes are implemented as indirect, prepaid, flat, value-added taxes.
%They are inherently regressive as earners of lower incomes spend relatively more of their available resources, and save little or nothing.
%Earners of high incomes, particularly from capital gains, also pay taxes on their eventual consumption, but consume less overall, and can earn untaxed interests from delayed consumption.
%
%Particularly in continental, Bismarck-type welfare states such as Germany, a great share of the increasing de-facto tax burden of insuring health, accident, old age, and unemployment burdens immobile bases of low- and medium-income labor as social contributions, or effective wage taxes \marginpar{\textsf{(references, numbers)}}.
%Like indirect taxes, they are regressive (above a certain threshold) over all earners, even when progressive on labor incomes.
%In Germany, they are straightforwardly regressive by means of capping. -->

<!-- %\paragraph{The Sad Tale of Progressive Income Taxation} Lastly remain the personal and corporate income tax.
%Here, the base has stayed the same, if not broadened through the filling of tax gaps \citep{Genschel2009}.
%Previously sharply progressive rates have been cut to generally no higher than 40\% on average (not at the margin) \marginpar{\textsf{(insert more citations, graphs, empirical evidence here)}}.
%
%\subparagraph{Loophole:
%Foreign Corporate Income Tax} International capital mobility is operative in depressing the personal income tax by providing possibilities for evading domestic corporate taxes abroad.
%
%When income taxes are progressive, international capital mobility provides a way out.
%High earners can invest in companies abroad, the earnings of which will not be taxed at domestic rates.
%Eventual capital inflows (assuming perfect tax administration) will be taxed, but avoiding the taxation of interest and sharp progression through income smoothing.
%
%\paragraph{Dysfunctions of Progressive Income Taxation} Progressive income taxation is also problematic because it creates disincentives for saving by taxing it twice, once when it is initially earned, and then again, when it generates an interest.
%More generally, progressive income taxation could be criticized to reduce the rewards for hard work and risk-taking investment - which is to some extent true for all progressive schedules.
%
%\subparagraph{The Ugly:
%Corporate Income Tax} The necessary antecedent of a progressive income tax, a \emph{corporate} income tax, creates further dysfunctional dynamics.
%It is prone to international tax competition of its highly mobile base, as argued in the above.
%
%Moreover, corporate income taxation necessarily applies one uniform rate over the entire firm (if not economy), thereby counteracting the individual different and progressive rate of the income tax.
%
%The lifesavings of a worker, invested in a company through her life insurance, are taxed at exactly the same rate as the share of a stock-market tycoon.
%
%Most troublesome, a corporate income tax is fundamentally indeterminate with regard to its base:
%whether, and to which degree its incidence falls on labor (the respective employees) or capital (the respective owners), is a matter of econometric uncertainty and likely depends on a host of firm- and market-specific factors, including the price elasticities of capital and labor \citep{Graetz2009}.
%
%To sum up, a progressive income tax with its antecedent, a (progressive) corporate income tax, \begin{enumerate} \item{undermines the progressive logic of taxation,} \item{arbitrarily burdens capital or labor, and} \item{taxes saving twice,} \end{enumerate} all of which can contribute to the structural underfunding of the state.
%
%Counteracting progression hurts revenues by offering possibilities for tax evasion.
%An arbitrary burdening of capital or labor can contribute to a haphazard macro-economic disequilibrium between the two factors of production, wherein one is underemployed (credit crunch or unemployment, respectively), that will be further elaborated in the below.
%Taxing saving twice reduces incentives to accumulate capital, which is conducive to growth and thereby erodes the future basis of taxation.
%
%\subsubsection{Mututally Reinforcing Twin Crisis}
%
%To make matters worse, the two crises of structural unemployment and structural underfunding mutually reinforce each other.
%
%\paragraph{Regressive, Indirect Taxation Creates Unemployment} The move towards the less mobile tax bases of consumption, low- and medium labor income makes matters worse on the low- and medium productivity labor market.
%
%\subparagraph{Higher Price Floors} A high VAT, regressive that it is, burdens low-income earners more and directly raises the necessary socially acceptable minimum income by that percentage.
%The same applies to capped, wage tax-style social contributions which add an extra \marginpar{\textsf{(include figures, references here)}} wedge between labor productivities and effective price floors.
%
%More generally, the same applies to low- and medium-income taxation, where, when burdened proportionately (or \emph{out} of proportion, really) with other natural persons and their capital, incentives to work in the presence of effective price floors disappear.
%
%\subparagraph{Procyclical Labor Costs} A further corollary of pseudo-independent but in fact quasi-fiscal administration of social contributions is a highly procyclical dynamic:
%when collective labor demand falls during a macroeconomic slump, costs of labor will rise, further reducing the demand for labor.
%
%\paragraph{Underinvestment Makes Permanent Structural Unemployment}
%Measured by its success to guarantee productive work for everyone at socially acceptable pay, the present revenue configuration can indeed be diagnosed to be fundamentally underfunding the welfare state.
%
%Less``political'' and more clearly, the underfunded state cannot afford the titanic transformations, colossal investments and massive redistribution (!) needed in education to equip the future workforce with the necessary skills to maintain and enhance our gross domestic production.
%To attain a future where every healthy adult is productive enough to earn a socially acceptable income without transfers or "idleness below the price floor" for now requires a gigantic upfront investment, a polity potent enough to redirect resources at collective, democratic will.
%
%\subparagraph{Approximating an Absolute, Not Moving Socially Acceptable Minimum} Critics will rightfully point out, that at any level and non-uniform distribution of skills, productivities and GDP, there will be people below the average.
%It is of course circularly true, that it will be impossible to assume said goal if we assume``socially acceptable minimum'' to be anything close to a moving average.
%I find this critique misleading on two counts.
%
%First of all, it assumes that in fact, what we find acceptable, or happiness, is a relative, not an absolute concept.
%There are good normative, conceptual \marginpar{\textsf{(cite literature on diminishing returns to wealth)}} and empirical \marginpar{\textsf{(cite happiness research, in particular \cite{Veenhoven-2005-ab})}} that suggest that this is, in fact, not the case.
%
%Being able to pay for your kids' schooltrip rather than not may just make the difference, somewhat independent of whether that other person just bought her third vacation home.
%
%Also, the ``moving average dilemma'' is impossible to achieve in the absolute --- but we can still be closer, or farther away from it.
%What the above goal then means is to compress the distribution around that moving average, not to flatten it out entirely.
%In education, that goal of a flattened income distribution is achieved not through zero-sum style, straightforward but blunt redistribution, but through collectively and individually beneficial investments into human capital.
%
%\subsection{A Vicious Cycle of Impotence}
%From the present fiscal configuration emerges a vicious cycle of the twin crises of structural unemployment and structural underfunding.
%A vicious cycle, in which an ever eroding ability to tax, collectively invest, and redistribute continues to impair the state \marginpar{\textsf{(Cite \cite{Zurn-2000-aa}} and others on input/output incongruency here)}.
%A vicious cycle which creates a hollowed out, impotent polity which is no longer able to decisively redirect its resources with a view to long-term social optima.
%
%A political economy emerges, which increasingly --- if unsustainably --- redistributes the collectively available fruits of labor, skill and this planets resources to a well-qualified, mobile and capital-owning elite.
%A political economy which unleashes a new dynamic of economic bifurcation, thought to be overcome after Manchester capitalism \marginpar{\textsf{(reference \cite{Taleb2007}} and talk about scale-free dynamics of capital accumulation here)}.
%This time around, workers may not be left in quite a dire state --- we may just allow them sufficiently large transfers for them not to starve or create unrest.
% Alternatively, they may be brought back into work under dire conditions, rather than transfers.
%This latter lowering of socially acceptable incomes and working conditions appears to be the trend under recent policies curbing benefit levels.
%
%In any case, a meaningful participation in the society and wider partaking in its fruits may be limited to only a subset of people. -->

### Crisis of Equality

<!-- (not sure about this one) -->

<!-- %look into the short paper by Frank again.
%\cite{Frank1996} argues that top salaries have grown because of 1) technological forces that greatly amplify small increments in performance (non-linear returns to scale?) and 2) increased competition for services of top performers (not sure what this is).
%In winner-take all markets you pay by relative, not absolute performance.

%note the ``expenditure cascade'' Frank argument. -->

Again, not an empirical claim per se, but it seems worth nothing that as per a priori logic, there may be runaway dynamics of inequality, for which we might have no *possible* counteracting tax institution.
pperhaps, we don't actually want to use that institution, or only to a limited amount, because its costs are too high, or the boons of overall growth are too great, but whatever, it'd be nice to have it available to the sovereign.

A complete empirical test of the governing dynamics of inequality is beyond the scope of this thesis.
[^5]
Here are some tentative statistics which support the thesis of self-reinforcing inequality.

According to the US Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) the range between the lowest and highest sextile (!) of median before-tax family income has risen from \$145,000 in 1989 to \$170,000 in 2004 [@Bucks2006].
During the same period, the mean gap between the outer sextiles has increased from roughly \$245,000 to \$295,000 (*ibid.*).
The mean income gap for extreme quartiles of education of head of household has increased from \$80,000 \$115,000 (*ibid.*).
While the *median* net worth is reported to to be roughly \$90,000 in 2004, the respective *mean* is around \$450,000.
The median (mean) range between the outer quintiles (!) of net worth has increased from \$1,000,000 (around \$1,800,000) in 1989 to above \$1,400,000 (\$3,000,000) in 2004.
Interestingly, even the median (mean) gap between the topmost quintiles has increased from \$600,000 (\$1,500,000) to \$900,000 (above \$2,500,00).
[^6]

In Germany, a similar trend is discernible.
From 1998 to 2006, the Gini coefficients
[^7]
in real gross wages (not incomes!)
[^8]
continuously rose from 0.407 to 0.453 [@Bundesregierung2006 14].
Interestingly, even the range between the topmost deciles in share of all gross wages rose from 9.8 to 10.6 [@Grabka2007a 64].
For all gross (net) incomes the Gini coefficient rose (roughly continuously) from 0.465 (0.261) to 0.520 (0.316) [-@Grabka2007a 82].
The Gini of wealth distribution rose continuously from 0.745 in 2002 to 0.795 in 2007 [-@Grabka2007a 138].

In sum, inequality seems to be increasing over time, in labor and capital income, and in wealth.
Distributions of income and wealth are, in fact, decidedly non-normal, but starkly positively skewed as evidenced by the ever diverging medians and means.
These tentative statistics then support the central tenet of self-reinforcing governing dynamics of inequality.

[^2]: I assume here that market wages are low *only* because of low productivities, in keeping with condition itm:infinite-buyers-sellers ().
    If, by contrast, employers have great bargaining power over non-unionized workers (as appears to be the case in much of the service sector) they may receive low wages even when their labor productivities are adequate.
    Such Manchester-capitalism styled exploitation should be met with regulatory, not fiscal interventions:
    otherwise, government may end up transferring to exploitative firms.

    It does not matter *why* labor productivity of some groups of workers is in *relative* decline.
    Candidate culprits include international trade and finance (for example, discredited @Stolper1941) as well as skill-based technological progress [@Card2001].
    Whatever the reason for low relative labor productivities, an efficient fiscal configuration should help factor markets clear.

[^5]: Also, comprehensive data about income and wealth distributions are conspicuously hard to come by.
    Most government or international organizations report only various *risk of poverty indicators* or, at best, decile ranges or ratios.
    Gini coefficients, histograms or more comprehensive measures of income dispersion are not readily available, particular for wealth.
    The statistics that are provided oddly focus on poverty --- not on inequality --- and use *ordinal* measures of dispersion (decile ranges), which, by definition, conceal outliers in skewed distributions.
    The few, notable examples of more comprehensive datasets include the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) [@Wagner2007; @Grabka2007].

[^6]: Comparing two years, of course, does not make a trend.
    For most indicators of inequality in the triennial SCF, there is a continuous upward trend beginning in the latter half of the 1990s, with a noticeable dip in inequality in the early 1990s [@Bucks2006].

[^7]: The Gini coeffecient is a comprehensive measure of inequality in cardinal distributions.
    It measures the divergence of actual distributions from uniform ("egalitarian") distributions.
    Zero is perfect equality, one is perfect inequality.

[^8]: Labor incomes are likely to display relatively *less* inequality than total incomes, or wealth.
    Labor incomes are (page ).

    It emerges the picture of a world, where the link between initial states and outcomes is highly non-linear.
    Marginal increases in, say, education, may lead to very large income effects --- or none at all.
    A world, where not everyone can be the meritocratic master of her own luck.
    A little more effort *may* get you that big year-end bonus, or a lot of effort may get you no reward at all.
    A world, where economic and social outcomes do not follow a bell-shaped distribution, with most people around mean incomes and status, and very few at the extremes.
    This is a world, where both those left and right of the mean will get ever farther away from it.

    The governing dynamics of inequality are that of the Matthew Principle, popularized by Robert K. [@Merton1988; @Jackson1968].
    Left to its own devices, the (post?)industrial economy is a "winner-take-all ecology" [@Taleb2007], accurately described in the words of scripture cited above.


### Efficiency and Equity

Equity and efficiency are not a zero-sum trade-off.
Sometimes, when the cake is sliced up more equitably, it may grow.
Formulations of such positive-sum relationship between the two vary, and only some examples can be given here.

<!-- efficiency vs equity
Equity and efficiency, at the extremes, are not as conceptually orthogonal as conveniently assumed:
Excessive inefficiency is, in fact, likely to be inequitable, too, as government failure to provide public goods and pool risks has a social gradient.
Poorer individuals will be hit harder, because public goods and lemons markets are not, in truth, dichotomous and uniform phenomena.
In the real world, some public goods (for example, policing) have close, if costly private good substitutes (for example, gated community.
Similarly, some risks will be more symmetrically observable (for example, buyers of private health insurance in Germany tend to be better and better-known risks).
Alternatively, rich people may have enough assets to forego risk pooling alltogether (for example, excessive co-payments).
In short, rich people can often buy their way out of otherwise underfunded or failing public institutions, creating yet greater inequities [@Barry2002]. -->
<!-- %Moreover, inequality and common/public goods and risk pooling are not as distinct concepts as presented in the above table, when taken to the (reasonable) extreme and adding a dynamic dimension.
%
%Inequality is, in the above assumed to be a policy challenge in its own right, that calls for \emph{redistribution}.
%Alternatively, from a more dynamic perspective, gross, self-reinforcing inequities could also be framed as public or common good problems, where excessive inequality exerts a negative externality of non-opportunity on the poorgTaking things further into the future, presently existing inequality could be assumed to exert a negative externality on the future, forgoing otherwise more broadly-based growth.
%
%Conversely, excessive underprovision of common/public goods or a lack of effective risk-pooling easily hits the poor hardest, who have few other resources to buy or substitute the lacking goods.
%
%Policy makers should, however, be careful not to introduce duplicate redistributive mechanisms in other state activities, such as Pigouvian taxes or fees, which are not geared towards everyone, but a certain type of behavior or service consumed.
%
%A further requirement of ``regulatory neatness'' and corrolarly of this thinking is that redistributive and revenue-generation taxes should in principal be levied on natural persons exclusively.
%Only between natural persons is redistribution meaningful, even ignoring the above-mentioned problems of incidence and uniform progression discussed in the above. -->

<!-- Extravagant inequalities that bear no meaningful relationship between effort and reward squander talent as Malcolm @Gladwell argues in *Outliers* [-@Gladwell].
This pop-sociological debunking of the meritocratic myth resonates with needs
for a large and highly qualified workforce, and concerns of social immobility in (post)industrial economies (for example, Lisbon Strategy, EU 2020).
For a knowledge economy, you need lots of qualified and motivated people, not just a few stars.
### Structural Unemployment {#sec:StructuralUnemployment} -->
<!-- TODO I think this needs another quote on incomplete contracts or sth -->

Extreme inequality in post-tax market outcomes may also conflict with the efficiency goal of full factor employment.
Most (post)industrial societies have legislated socially accepted minimal incomes.
This legislation takes the form of statutory minimum wages or unemployment benefits.
Either way, an effective or de-facto price floor for wages is established.
[^1]

[^1]: Income subsidies or negative income taxes may not lead to such dysfunctional price floors ([c.f.](http://maxheld.de/2010/04/19/sharing-the-burden/) @Held2010).

People with productivities *below* this price floor will not find employment, leading to a DWL of structural unemployment.
[^2]

Crucially, the level of minimal incomes depends on the broader configuration of tax incidence, indirect taxes in particular.
When taxes are relatively flat and fall on labor or consumption, the real costs of living for low-income earners rise.
This *tax wedge* can take the form of (flat or proportional, payroll-style) social contributions, VAT or a relatively flat or proportional personal income tax:
either way, *more* money has to be made on the market for the same living standard (in Purchasing Power Parities, PPP).

The implications for tax design are twofold:

#### Structural Unemployment as Endogenous.

The only genuine fix to structural unemployment is of course more education to lift people, or at least their children, out of their low standards of productivity.
Better education, to be sure, will require fresh ideas --- but also lots of public resources.
Well-funded public education, in turn, is endogenous to a fiscal configuration.

#### Structural Unemployment as Exogenous.

Even from a static perspective, assuming low-productivity workers to be exogenous, some measure of tax relief for would-be working poor may enhance welfare.
An efficient tax system should reduce the burden on low-productivity earners, to keep their post-tax socially acceptable minimum wages as low as possible.

[\[des:low-price-floor\]]{#des:low-price-floor label="des:low-price-floor"}
A desirable tax has a minimal incidence on low-productivity earners to lower their cost of living.


## Bad Tax

> *"Things in tax are bad today."*\
> --- Edward J. @McCaffery2005 [893]

The Forerunner: Indirect, Proportional Taxes: VAT & Payroll {#sec:ScoreVAT}

Indirect, proportional taxes are the forerunners in tax choice today.
For the last two to three decades, they have assumed an ever greater share of GDP, compared to other taxes (for Germany and the UK, see [@Kemmerling2009 11].

VAT and Payroll, for all their differences, share key characteristics:
they are indirect, they are proportional and they fall on relatively immobile bases.

#### Neutrality.

The key merit of indirect, proportional taxation is its neutrality to relative prices in the economy:
deadweight losses are indeed , as per desideratum [\[des:minimal-DWL\]](#des:minimal-DWL){reference-type="ref" reference="des:minimal-DWL"}.

##### Everyone Has to Consume.

For the VAT, the neutrality case is clear-cut.
Ultimately, people can only spend the savings and (capital, labor) income they have on goods on the market.
If buying of *all* goods is proportionally taxed, people have no way to avoid the tax.
They *cannot* react to a price signal that is *universally* increased:
their (page ) is minimal.
The same holds for sellers:
they have to sell to someone.
When every potential buyer has to bear the same tax, sellers have no way to react.
Their (p. ) is minimal, too.
The VAT falls on a as per desideratum [\[des:tax-inelastic\]](#des:tax-inelastic){reference-type="ref" reference="des:tax-inelastic"}.

##### Everyone Has to Work ...

A proportional payroll tax is neutral when one accepts an exclusive, (page ).
When capital rents are only *compensation* for risky, deferred consumption all savings and capital rents are ultimately labor incomes.
Under the , someone living off her savings is someone living off her past work.
In short, to consume and to live at all, everybody has to work, for someone, sometime.
If you have to work for someone, and every potential employment is subject to the same, proportional tax, you cannot react to the tax.
Again, the of labor supply (page ) is minimal.
The same holds for employers:
they have to employ someone.
If every potential employer is subjected to the same, proportional tax, their of labor demand (page ) is minimal, too.
[^7]

##### ...Except the Rich.

Under a (page ), a proportional tax is not neutral.
When capital rents are a genuine increment to wealth, there is an alternative to work:
you can either work, or live off your interest.
In formal terms, rich people can substitute their labor income with capital income.
As the availability of substitutes increases price elasticity, the labor supply by rich people is no longer price inelastic.
Absent the payroll tax, they might have elected to work more than they will if their labor income is taxed.

##### Ideally, A Ordoliberally Hygienic Tax.

A neutral tax, by definition, has no fee or pigouvian component.
A VAT or payroll tax with a proportional, uniform rate is as per desideratum [\[des:ordoliberal-hygiene\]](#des:ordoliberal-hygiene){reference-type="ref" reference="des:ordoliberal-hygiene"}.

#### Redistribution $=$ General Revenue?

To the extent that proportional taxation is accepted as an equity norm (!), a VAT or payroll that goes into general government revenue is a proper instrument both to , as a desirable tax should as per desideratum [\[des:redistribution-and-revenue-are-one\]](#des:redistribution-and-revenue-are-one){reference-type="ref" reference="des:redistribution-and-revenue-are-one"}.

In Germany and many other countries, *capped* payroll taxes are used to raise social insurance contributions.
Here, redistribution and revenue generation undesirably interact.

First, social insurance contributions are proper taxes:
they serve to pool risks and they redistribute between old and young, healthy and sick.
Second, these services are actually provided universally and unconditionally:
as a last resort, the (German) welfare state pays even for those who have *not* contributed.
The welfare state polity, has in other words, already adopted an allocative norm.

Raising revenue for these very services on a *regressive* schedule (capped) on only some incomes (employed labor) embodies another, very specific allocation, for which no normative justification is readily available.
In Germany, only employed people pay for the health insurance of all other employed people.
Exactly *why*, at minimum, self-employed people do not also contribute to this risk pool is unexplained, but allocatively consequential.

#### Fairness.

At best, a VAT or payroll tax can be regarded as a proportional taxation on as per desideratum [\[des:personal-taxation\]](#des:personal-taxation){reference-type="ref" reference="des:personal-taxation"}.
[^8]
It cannot accommodate progression, let alone an arbitrarily steep schedule.

##### Payroll: Regressive.

An (ideal) payroll tax is proportional only under an (page ).
When capital rents are regarded as proper income (, page ), a payroll tax falls only on one of two types of incomes.
A payroll tax is clearly not , as mandated by desideratum [\[des:structural-agnosticism\]](#des:structural-agnosticism){reference-type="ref" reference="des:structural-agnosticism"}.

##### VAT: Proportional.

No matter the savings norm, a VAT is straightforwardly proportional, because *all* income is ultimately consumed and tax liable to generate utility.

##### Different Rates Are Not An Option.

One common alteration to make the VAT fairer is to adopt different rates for different types of products.
Goods that cover basic needs (food) often enjoy a lower VAT rate.
In a complex economy and modern society, it is impossible to easily determine which goods satisfy basic needs and which do not.
Is a meat a basic need?
Is a filet mignon?
Is a filet mignon every day?
<!-- %more generally, this violates the norm of neutrality, it will affect less people who buy 10 sedans than people who buy 1 luxury car.
%This is about as non-agnostic as it gets. -->

When the state *does* establish different VAT rates, it risks becoming a micro-manager of fairness and will create arbitrary incentives for cross-substitution.

#### The Problems of Proportional Taxation.

Aside from not being progressive, a proportional tax raises a number of problems (page ).

##### Diminishing Utility and Positional Consumption.

As proportional taxes, VAT and payroll cannot consider of wealth, income or consumption.
Whether you are struggling to pay for the first class trip of your child or whether you are thinking about signing up your child for the third summer school, the taxman will treat these two transactions equally, irrespective of the clearly differential impact on the subjective well-being --- not to mention opportunity --- of parents and child in these two families.

Similarly, a proportional VAT on consumption can also not curb ().
Whether you are buying a high-priced Mercedes sedan because you enjoy a luxury car during your frequent trips on the German autobahn, or whether you are buying it merely because you do not want the smaller car than your neighbor, the taxman will treat these two transactions equally, with no regard to a potentially wasteful, positional component of consumption.

##### Proportional Taxation Raises the Effective Price Floor of Labor.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:PropTaxDWL\]]{#sec:PropTaxDWL label="sec:PropTaxDWL"}
Most problematically, any proportional taxation will make it relatively more expensive for low-income earners to make ends meet.
In welfare states with legislated or effective minimal standards of living, such an increase in the real costs of living will push more people into structural unemployment.
When every trip to the grocery store gets more expensive, more low-skilled people will be unable to afford a socially acceptable minimal standard of living from their equilibrium incomes.
Conversely, the (very price-elastic) demand for such low-qualification service jobs drops dramatically, as struggling workers try to extract higher wages (Scharpf in foreword to @Ganghof2004 [12ff]).
An equivalent dynamic holds for proportional payroll taxes.

Proportional taxation raises the in violation of desideratum [\[des:low-price-floor\]](#des:low-price-floor){reference-type="ref" reference="des:low-price-floor"}.
Present some income-replacing transfer scheme, as is nearly universally the case in developed welfare states, supply for low-productivity work becomes very elastic:
you can either work for *less* net purchasing power, or receive *same* or a little more from the state for not working at all.
Proportional VAT or payroll taxation then creates a substantial of structural unemployment, disallowed in desideratum [\[des:minimal-DWL\]](#des:minimal-DWL){reference-type="ref" reference="des:minimal-DWL"}.
[^9]

##### Limited Stabilization.

Proportional taxation, by definition cannot serve as an automatic stabilizer.
When the schedule is linear, it does not matter how lumpy your consumption is.
A VAT or ideal payroll will do nothing to prevent you from buying nothing during a bust, and too much during a boom.

A proportional VAT could, theoretically serve as an discretionary stabilizer if government were to lower the VAT rate during the downturn.
People would have an incentive to buy at lower taxes during the downturn, rather than later at higher rates.

Unemployment insurance works as an automatic stabilizer because of how the revenue is *used*, and not how it is *raised*.
Consumption is smoothed out as the incomes of laid-off workers are insured in the medium term.
Two problems remain:
First, laid-off workers can still consume less than they optimally should, maybe because they are anticipating a prolonged, uninsured downturn.
Second, unemployment insurance would be a much better automatic stabilizer if it were raised in a manner that also smoothes consumption.

#### A Mixed Bag For Capitalism.

On the pro side, a VAT and proportional payroll tax let entrepreneurs make their own production decisions, and on their own dime and incentive.

A VAT and proportional payroll tax also do not require , as disallowed by desideratum [\[des:liquid-assets\]](#des:liquid-assets){reference-type="ref" reference="des:liquid-assets"}.

On the other hand, a VAT and proportional payroll tax does little to avoid (page ff.).
If capital is concentrated in the hands of only a few people, the rest will not be able to close intelligently incentivized deals on their unobservable effort and uncertain innovations.

#### A Tiny Little Bit Difference Principle.

For all its equity and efficiency shortcomings, a proportional VAT shares the fundamental merit of all consumption taxes:
it taxes a normatively justifiable basis.
Taxing consumption, not incomes, may be desirable under the the , as per desideratum [\[des:difference-principle\]](#des:difference-principle){reference-type="ref" reference="des:difference-principle"}.
This is presented in greater detail and strength in [\[sec:foundational-beauty\]](#sec:foundational-beauty){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:foundational-beauty"} on the *Progressive* Consumption Tax.
Absent progression, the difference principle merits of the VAT are negligible.

The merit of consumption taxation under VAT also manifests itself in the (somewhat
[^10]
positive savings rate it allows for..
If government would raise its revenue exclusively through a VAT, people's incentive to save would be unaltered:
as argued in the above, a VAT is agnostic towards capital or labor incomes.

The Old Hand --- Direct, Progressive Taxes: PIT, CIT & Dual PIT {#sec:ScorePIT}
---------------------------------------------------------------

The [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} is the archetypical modern tax designed to redistribute.
It was conceived in the early to mid 19th century to address the inequities of early capitalism.

#### Income Taxation Punishes Saving.

A [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} can cause two different kinds of in desideratum [\[des:minimal-DWL\]](#des:minimal-DWL){reference-type="ref" reference="des:minimal-DWL"}.

First, if insufficiently progressive (= near proportional), it causes the discussed for VAT and payroll taxes (page ).

Second, if it is sufficiently progressive on both labor and capital incomes, it taxes savings twice:
once when they are earned, and a second time when they yield an interest (and yet again when they yield a compound interest).
This has a number of negative implications.

When people can avoid double taxation by consuming income right away, they may very well do so.
Capital incomes are taxed, even though saving is elastic.
This conflicts with desideratum [\[des:tax-inelastic\]](#des:tax-inelastic){reference-type="ref" reference="des:tax-inelastic"} ().
Things become even more awry when we consider investments (savings) of different risk.
When the (uncertain, but higher) rewards of risky investment are taxed progressively, people will have a smaller incentive to run the risk in the first place.
The PIT still allows for local, decentralized production decisions but incentives are substantially dampened.

A PIT discourages saving, and it falls twice on capital income, and only once on labor income.

#### The Merits of Progression.

It also serves to of labor as per desideratum [\[des:low-price-floor\]](#des:low-price-floor){reference-type="ref" reference="des:low-price-floor"}.
The problematic double taxation of capital incomes also serves to substantially dampen and ensures *some* degree of broad ownership.

#### The Limits of Progression Under the PIT.

A tax on *income*, by definition, does little to curb .

More fundamentally, a PIT does *not* allow for truly arbitrarily steep schedules.
For a high *average* tax rate on incomes say, 50%, *marginal* tax rates would be prohibitively high.
Such high marginal tax rates would all but destroy at that margin at all.
It seems likely that a PIT will be no match to the (page ), given its limited steepness in progression.

#### No Stabilization.

As any tax on income, the PIT cannot serve as an effective automatic or discretionary stabilizer.

#### The Systemic Flaws of the PIT.

Aside from its limited and problematic merits, the PIT carries with it some unavoidable, inherent flaws.

##### The PIT's Ugly or Unfair trade-off: Accrual vs. Realization.

Because the PIT is based on flows of economic welfare, it requires a method to measure these flows.
Whenever assets are illiquid
the taxman can either wait indefinitely for realization, or tax on some assumed accrual.
Either way, substantial welfare losses ensue and desideratum [\[des:liquid-assets\]](#des:liquid-assets){reference-type="ref" reference="des:liquid-assets"} on the is violated.

Income taxation on accrual or realization also has substantial equity implications.
In contrast to the VAT, it is *not* merely a matter of timing when we pay the income tax.

> "Such a statement reveals a basic failure to understand --- or a desire that others not understand --- the nature of income taxation and tax avoidance:
> \[...\] if income tax can be postponed \[...\], interest (or other capital income) can be earned on a tax deferred basis in the meantime."\
> --- McLure (1988 @Seidman1997 [125])

In short:
taxation on realization ignores compound interest.

##### Tax Evasion 101: Buy, Borrow, Die.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:TaxEvasion101\]]{#sec:TaxEvasion101 label="sec:TaxEvasion101"}
A sinister exploitation of the evaluation problem of the PIT goes by the name of *buy, borrow, die*.
[^11]

It emerges from the following three doctrines, all of which make sense in isolation.

First, a PIT never taxes debt as income.
It makes little sense to tax debt:
according to @Haig1921-@Simons1938 (equation eq:HaigSimons) and common intuition, the income-generating ability of a person does not change just because she takes out a loan.
Consequently, people pay their taxes on the income they use to repay principal and interest.

Second, for the practical reason of avoiding evaluations by a central planner, the PIT is levied on realization, not accrual.

Third, for @Haig1921-@Simons1938 and common intuition, heirs are (estate) taxed only net of assets and liabilities handed down to them.

So far so good?
These three trivially intuitive doctrines, in combination constitute the fatal achilles heel of effective capital income taxation.
Tax evaders can follow a simple, and entirely legal strategy.
First, they *buy* appreciating, but illiquid assets.
In a second step, they *borrow* money on the appreciating asset as collateral.
Recall that this cash inflow is not taxed.
Also recall that lenders may very well consider the yet-illiquid appreciation of the asset in extending their loan terms.
Tax evaders can now spend out of the appreciation of the asset without paying *any* capital income tax on this de-facto accrual of welfare.
Third, tax evaders *die* and bequest their assets to someone else.
That someone else is liable only for estate tax on the *net* value of the assets and liabilities.
The consumption of the deceased tax evader is deducted from the net value.
Again, ultimately, and irrevocably, consumed capital incomes escape taxation.

This loophole, like the underlying problem of , is *not* a practical aberration that could conceivably be closed.
Any income tax on realization will offer this evasive strategy.
<!-- %is this an entirely new problem, or does this fall adequately under "don't tax illiquid stuff?" Can I break it down like that?
%Or is there maybe another thing behind it?
%Timing?
%Is it all accrual vs realization? -->

This is not a hypothetical or esoteric problem.
The pre-2007 housing bubble in the U.S., Spain and elsewhere was --- amongst other factors --- also fueled by this strategy.
Houses were good illiquid assets (*buy*).
Banks willingly offered mortgages on the houses (*borrow*).
They also happily refinanced the loan, if the suggested (but unrealized!) fair market value of the house had increased.
Consumers took out a bigger mortgage on the (supposedly) appreciated house and spent the difference on a new SUV and a flat screen TV.
All tax free.

Appreciation in illiquid assets is no small component of our economic growth.
A colossal share of the real welfare that accrues to capital income earners escapes income taxation without further notice, and any readily available fix.

##### The PIT's Ugly Backstops: The Estate and Gift Tax.

It follows from the strategy of tax evasion 101 that an estate and gift tax are necessary backstops to the PIT.
Without a tax on the substance bequested, unrealized appreciations on illiquid assets would go entirely untaxed.
With an estate and gift tax, "only" the consumed part of unrealized appreciations escapes taxation.

The estate and gift taxes are, in themselves ugly beasts.
Just like the PIT, they require an evaluation of a flow of economic welfare in the potential absence of a market equilibrium price of that very flow.
If an entrepreneur bequests her family-owned firm to her daughter, no one can know how much it is worth.
Again, problems in the taxation of illiquid assets ensue.

##### The PIT's Ugly Backstops: The CIT.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:ScoreCIT\]]{#sec:ScoreCIT label="sec:ScoreCIT"}
A PIT has another, even uglier backstop:
the Corporate Income Tax.
Recall that a PIT is meant to tax all incomes, including interest and compound interest.
With only a PIT, tax evaders would have at their disposal a strategy even simpler than tax evasion 101:
they could place (or retain) their savings in an incorporated firm.
First, tax evaders could spread out their (spiky) income over a longer period of time to play the progressive schedule.
A small, but steady trickle of income is better than a large, lumpy flow under a progressive tax.
Second, and more fundamentally problematic, tax evaders can also retain their initial capital income in the corporation and have it earn a compound interest.
Note that the compound interest is earned on a capital income which, ideally, *should* have been taxed *already*.

To avoid this loophole, a PIT needs a CIT to get at the corporate shelter from the income tax [@Genschel2005 7].
Also empirically, PIT and CIT rates go hand in hand, between countries and over time, further supporting the intricate, if dysfunctional link between the two [@Piatkowski2008 14].

The CIT is as bad as the PIT, minus the merits of progressive, personal taxation of the PIT.

First, the CIT has no as demanded in desideratum [\[des:determined-incidence\]](#des:determined-incidence){reference-type="ref" reference="des:determined-incidence"} [@McCaffery2005 918].
Corporations are fictions.
If you tax them anyway, you violate desideratum [\[des:personal-taxation\]](#des:personal-taxation){reference-type="ref" reference="des:personal-taxation"} ().

Second and related, the CIT knows no progression.
To the extent the the CIT ever reliably fell on capital, it made some sense historically when corporate ownership was a reasonable proxy for the propertied classes.
This is no longer the case.
Many people receive capital incomes [@Grabka2007a XV].
The CIT has no way of distinguishing *between* different owners [@McCaffery2005 918].
Whether a particular Volkswagen share belongs to the life insurance of a single working mother or a stock market tycoon, both are taxed at some uniform corporate income rate .

Third, much like the PIT, the CIT itself is plagued by unavoidable loopholes.
The CIT is very sensitive to international tax rate competition:
if CIT rates differ from country to country, multinational companies can easily shift profits to the country with the lowest rate.
A number of strategies are available to do this, the simplest of which is to charge inflated (deflated) prices in intra-company trade [@Ganghof2004 43ff].
This loophole cannot be closed as inflation (deflation) of intra-company trade prices cannot be reliably detected.
More fundamentally, "any national claim to a particular share of \[a multinational's\] profits is hard to justify on the basis of principle" [@Genschel2005 61].
<!-- %also explain how they can always calculate themselves to zero, not just with arbitrage. -->

#### The Downgraded Upgrade: The Dual PIT.

\phantomsection
[\[sec:ScoreDualPIT\]]{#sec:ScoreDualPIT label="sec:ScoreDualPIT"}
To the extent that a Dual PIT has substantially lower, and proportional rates on capital incomes, it alleviates the PIT's disincentives to save and invest.
The Dual PIT is simply another non- relative burdening of capital and labor incomes in violation of desideratum [\[des:structural-agnosticism\]](#des:structural-agnosticism){reference-type="ref" reference="des:structural-agnosticism"}.

##### A Hollowed-Out PIT.

The relatively smaller burden on capital is hard to justify on principle.
The largest incomes are, by definition, capital incomes.
[^12]
Charging capital incomes a lower, proportional rate will greatly depress the overall progressivity of the PIT
Progression is limited under the PIT already, but will be even more compressed under a dual rate structure.

To the extent that more of the tax burden falls on labor, a Dual PIT will also raise the , as disallowed in desideratum [\[des:low-price-floor\]](#des:low-price-floor){reference-type="ref" reference="des:low-price-floor"}.

The Dual PIT is a PIT only in name.
It hollows out the ideal of universal progression.
The lower the rate on capital gets, the more a Dual PIT approximates a (progressive) payroll tax.

The Streaker --- Local Business Tax (LBT) {#sec:ScoreLBT}
-----------------------------------------

A tax on the earnings of local businesses shares all of the disadvantages of the CIT.

More fundamentally, the LBT is not a proper tax.
It should not need to be discussed here at all.

Local authorities provide different kinds of (see ).
The , and it provides should be financed out of general revenue.
A general revenue tax should fall only on as per desideratum [\[des:personal-taxation\]](#des:personal-taxation){reference-type="ref" reference="des:personal-taxation"}.

Local authorities also provide such as parks and such as sewers.
[^13]
Common good and natural monopolies should be financed out of Pigouvian levies (at marginal cost) and fees (at average cost), respectively.

The LBT sits in the nomansland somewhere between general revenue taxation and Pigouvian levy or fee.
It violates the norm of as per desideratum [\[des:ordoliberal-hygiene\]](#des:ordoliberal-hygiene){reference-type="ref" reference="des:ordoliberal-hygiene"}.

To the extent that the LBT is used to finances risk pools, public goods and redistributes, it should not be allowed to differ between municipalities.
If universal education is an allocative goal of the broader, national polity, everyone should pay for it.
<!-- %sometimes, such break-downs might be impractical, in that case, paying it out of general revenue might just be the better ticket. -->
If fire protection is a public good, everyone should pay for it.
LBT revenue used to finance these things should be replaced by transfers from higher levels of government.
<!-- %to avoid arbitrage
	%reference fiscal federalism -->

To the extent that the LBT is used to finance common goods or natural monopolies, it must specifically fall (at marginal or average cost, respectively) on the very consumption of these goods, and not on the earnings of a firm in general.
If industry pollutes a local river, *every unit of discharged pollution* should be (Pigouvian) taxed at marginal cost, not every firm in the city based on their earnings.
If some firms or citizens in a rural municipality require high-speed internet access (a natural monopoly), each *user* of the network should pay at average costs, not every firm in the vicinity.
Also note that LVT can replace this purpose to some extent.

In short, the LBT is an anti-ordoliberal streaker that should never have entered this game of perfect taxation.
It should be marshaled off the playing field as soon as possible.

Impotent Redistribution

## Deliberation and Democracy

Why does deliberating taxation matter for democracy?

A dysfunctional mixed economy without good taxes may produce illegitimate outputs, and, in so far as it disturbs the state-market balance of the mixed economy, violates output congruence of a democracy [compare @Zurn-2000-aa 190].
Yet, even if experts could agree on a tax --- such as a promising, post-paid, cash-flow based [pct]{acronym-label="pct" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- the tradeoffs involved in choosing or calibrating a tax regime are irreducibly political.
For example, experts cannot *positively* inquire whether economic "growth" [^positive_sum] is in itself *virtuous*, which inter-subjective aggregation would be *utility-maximizing*, what *deontological* rights owners have or which human *relationships* should be governed by prices or command at all --- even if they could agree on any of those alternative ethics.

[^positive_sum]: More precisely, the reaping of greater non-zero-sumness from social integration [@Wright2000].

<!-- TODO these are all discussed in *wanted* chapter -->
<!-- Even to the extent that tax choice can be left to economic a-priori or empirical analyses, of, for example, \glspl{dwl}, such expertise relies on contentious views of human nature \citep[for a review,][]{Persky1995}, and observations of nature are, in any event, devoid of moral messages \citep[43]{Gould1982}. -->
These metaphysical conundrums are reflected in very concrete, technocratic issues in taxation.
<!-- TODO add complete list here, those are old links issues in taxation, including \glspl{dwl} (p.~\pageref{sec:tax-optimality}), \hyperref[sec:diminishing-marginal-utility]{diminishing marginal utility} (p.~\pageref{sec:diminishing-marginal-utility}), the \hyperref[des:structural-agnosticism]{treatment of capital income} (p.~\pageref{des:structural-agnosticism}), or \hyperref[sec:love-marriage]{joint spousal taxation} (p.~\pageref{sec:love-marriage}), respectively. -->
Likewise, experts cannot justify the axioms on which their (economic) analyses rest:
whether, and under which institutional circumstances we are homines oeconomici, cannot be exhaustively answered from observation, because nature provides no intelligible moral messages on what kind of man we *should* be [@Gould1982 43].
<!-- again reference wanted chapter -->
This ontological stance matters for tax, too:
for an expert to model a general equilibrium is to invoke, as well as to make, a homo economicus.

Of all conceivable institutions to resolve these disagreements, deliberative --- not aggregative, not pluralist, not participatory --- democracy offers the greatest normative appeal, because these disagreements raise, in @Habermas-1984's words, competing *validity claims*, in need of argumentative redemption, as in:
is "growth" *comprehensible*, who *truly* bears a [cit]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="singular+short"}, is homo economicus *right*, and are social insurance employer co-payments *truthful*?
I illustrate further more, and less valid claims on taxation.
<!-- %I illustrate further more -- language does not work -->
<!-- TODO referer to validity-claims tex table here! -->
<!-- TODO INPUT validity claims table here! -->

Liberal democracy, born out of the hope that material inequality and political autonomy *can* be reconciled, especially, rests on deliberation, because if anywhere, it is in taxation that money and power may have replaced language to govern meaning and action [@Habermas-1971].
In fact, if you wanted to hide some process of (re)producing inequality anywhere, you could hardly find a better place than the intricacies of (income) taxation (consider, for example "tax planning 101" in @McCaffery2005 [888]).

Instead of communicative action [@Habermas-1984], what emerges today from citizens, their legislatures and public spheres, may be more "analytic muddle of tax" [@McCaffery2005 862].
The beliefs held and issues considered in the public [for example, @Caplan2007], appear to bear little resemblance to the abstractions suggested by economists [for example, @Harberger1974].
People seem to ignore fundamental choices in tax [for example, @McCafferyHines2010], and may fall for inconsequential alternatives [for example, @SausgruberTyran2011], possibly even err systematically against their own material interest --- if they are on the lower economic rungs [for a German example, @Kemmerling2009].
Here, too, (input) congruence of democratic rule may be violated if and to the extent that people are confused about policy choices [compare @Zurn-2000-aa 90].

	%Dalton (ibid.) has pointed out that voter disaffection may in fact be regarded as democratically desirable, if we hold it to be indicators of critical citizen oversight of governance.

%Except to a very cold-hearted, and epistemologically narrow mind of rational choice, dwindling voter turnout (ibid.) must be alarming everyone that, if this ``snake [does not] shed its skin, [it may well] perish.'' (Antoine de Saint-Exup\'ery, The Little Prince).

%Explanations for voter disaffection and perceived underperformance vary, invoking amongst others ``government overload'' \citep{HuntingtonInternational-Affairs.-1968-aa}, ``post-material'' or ``emancipative'' change and dimensions of values \citep{InglehartWelzel-2005-aa}, mind-boggling ``reflexive modernization'' \citep{BeckGiddens-1994-aa} or a democratic deficit inducing ``denationalization'' {Zurn-2000-aa}.

%\subsection{Preference Aggregation in Liberal, Representative Democracy}
%Liberal, representative democracy, rests on a pluralist theory of governance (\citealt{Louw2005}:15).
%Pluralism, being both empirical hypothesis and normative prescription supposes that political power is, and \emph{should} be widely dispersed among society's interest groups.
%These interest groups, made up of ever active citizens, openly compete with one another, thereby preventing any one of them to become a dominant elite.

%Institutional manifestations of pluralism abound in today's real existing democracies, both of the majoritarian and consociational type \citep{Lijphart-1999-aa}, including the right to form parties, (particularistic) associations, minority protection as well as constitutional checks-and-balances on government.

%\subsection{An Economic Theory of Democracy}
%Anthony \cite{Downs-1957-aa}, in his seminal spatial modeling of democratic competition, expanded pluralism into a democratic theory of public choice, based on the rational self-interest of both voters (to live under policies they prefer) and politicians or parties (seeking or maintaining political power).

%\caption{The Median Voter (Downs 1957:
%118)}
%\end{figure}

%\paragraph{The Median Voter}In its simplest form, reproduced in \autoref{fig:Downs-Median-Voter}, the ``Economic Theory of Democracy'' suggests that in a unimodal, unidimensional and symmetric distribution of voter preferences under a single-member plurality (SMP) electoral system, only two parties will compete for the median voter, taking on a central position only marginally different from one another.
%Any new parties or otherwise diversions from the median position would quickly move towards that equilibrium position again.

%Downs provides a theory, explaining how differing preferences and disjunct interest groups get channeled into fewer parties and stable equilibrium.

%\paragraph{The Median Voter\emph{s}}In Downs' defense from often misconceived reiterations and undue criticism:
%his theory, misleadingly reduced to a ``Median Voter Theorem'' does \emph{not} stop here.
%He employs his theory to a wide range of given preference distributions and electoral systems, including multimodal distributions (with \emph{several}, local median voters), multiparty competition under proportional representation and antecedent coalition government.
%He even suggests, in a prelude to the much later ``issue'' literature (for instance \citealt{Abbe2003}), that parties may choose to ``sprinkle'' their position over a number of issues, so as to appeal to a broader electorate (\citealt[137]{Downs-1957-aa}).

%\paragraph{In a Nutshell \ldots} What remains of Downs' theory, and is of central importance here is distilled in the following axioms:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{Voter preferences can be modelled on a \emph{single dimension}.}
%	\item{Voter preferences are \emph{presocial}, or given \emph{ex-ante}.}
%	\item{The mode of party competition is a function of the voter preference distribution and the electoral system.}
%	\item{In the equilibrium, any mode of the preference distribution is occupied by a party, so as long as the electoral system threshold allows for another party.}

%Both \cite{Lazarsfeld1968} study of the 1940 U.S.\ presidential campaign and \cite{LipsetRokkan-1967-aa} historical account of party systems and voter alignments serve well as a contrasting foil for the post-pluralist critique to come.

%\paragraph{Erie County, OH, c.a.
%1940}Let's begin with Lazarsfeld, who in 1940 set out to study how voters made up their mind in Erie County, OH.
%He found a highly stable, neatly aligned political spectrum.
%77\% of the voters, he found, voted as their parents and grandparents had (\emph{ibid.}:
%xxxiii).
%People thought politically, as they were, socially:
%``social characteristics determine political preference'' (\emph{ibid.}:
%27) in that long past rural county.
%Also, and most significantly for the criticism to come, Lazarsfeld found that:
%\begin{quote} \emph{A very large majority of \textbf{both} groups thought that it would be the common man, the plain people, the working class, who would benefit if Roosevelt were elected.
%\textbf{Both} groups also agreed, although not to the same extent, that Willkie's victory would be best for the business class.\\ \citealt[28, emphasis added]{Lazarsfeld1968}.}
%\end{quote}
%Where campaigns where influential, they acted to make voting \emph{more} consistent with the social group of the voters (\emph{ibid.}:
%139).

%This is of course a finding very much in line with the modeling assumption of \cite{Downs-1957-aa}:
%voter preferences seemed to differ on a single dimension, and, to a large extent, where given.

%\paragraph{Where You Stand on an Issue Depends on Where You Sit \ldots}
%\cite{LipsetRokkan-1967-aa} provide a broader history of social cleavages and and antecedent voter alignments and party systems, of which the ``worker'' --``business'' nexus in Erie County is only the last of a number of stages.
%Analyzing the history of political competition in Europe, they lay out a dialectic of conflict and integration, ranging from early modern centre-periphery and church-state struggles to early-industrial urban-rural and late-industrial owner-worker conflict (\emph{ibid.}:
%93).
%These evolving cleavages, in their account, shape and diversify preferences and parties as new ones layer on past ones, slowly fading away.
%While their historical analysis is limited to Europe, a broader insight remains:
%how, at least in the past, political preferences and parties followed broader patterns of socio-economic difference and bifurcation\footnote{It should be noted that \cite{LipsetRokkan-1967-aa} with their suggestion of layered, cross-cutting cleavages, do of course stand in sharp contrast with \cite{Downs-1957-aa} assumption of a unidimensional preferences space.
%The implications of this early, conceptual disagreement with Downs are however of little relevance to the argument presented here.}.

%\paragraph{No Nostalgia\ldots}
%To be clear, not all was good in Erie County, OH, c.a.
%1940.
%These neatly-aligned voters, following more their family tradition than their own thinking, were far away from to the ideal of a well-informed, active citizen.
%The socio-economic determination of the preferences they displayed are the vert politics of zero-sum redistribution, which all too often result in violent strife and the destruction of a democratic system.
%This bifurcated electorate is the very antithesis to those cross-cutting cleavages that at least the consociational theorists of democracy cherish so much \citep{Lijphart-1999-ab}.

%\paragraph{\ldots and yet:
%it \emph{Worked}}
%Its non-emancipated voters and explosive configuration notwithstanding, some key characteristics of this late modern political competition seem worthy do condense, building on the aforementioned axioms of Downs:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{Political preferences are presocial, given ex-ante.}
%	\item{Political preferences are determined by socio-economic status.}
%	\item{Political parties compete on differential policies, geared to different socio-economic strata, but on the same dimension.}
%\end{enumerate}

%\section{A Doubtful Demand Side:
%The Woes of the Rational Voter}

%\subsection{Our Dumb Voters:
%Non-Attitudes}
%The first grain of normative and conceptual doubt in the reliability of a Downsian, pluralist aggregation machine comes from \citeauthor{Converse-1970-aa}'s \citeyear{Converse-1970-aa} seminal work on ``Attitudes and Non-Attitudes''.
%In his panel studies, he finds that a substantial sub-group of voters has entirely random attitudes on, amongst others, the relative role of government and the market, with close to zero correlations between test and retest.
%This result, Converse warns, holds even when respondents were encouraged \emph{not} to respond.
%Moreover, the subgroup that displays random attitudes is more likely to report extreme attitudes in either direction.

%Less elegantly modeled, but more broadly applied findings come from a vast array of public opinion surveys, aptly summarized by \cite{Delli-CarpiniKeeter-1996-aa}.
%Findings suggest that many voters do not have even the most basic knowledge of political processes or platforms.

%A discussion of the complications and questions that arise from this area of research is beyond the scope if this treatment, and with limited relevance to the question at hand.

%It remains to be noted that the Downsian \citeyearpar{Downs-1957-aa} assumption of pre-social, unidimensional preferences, and to an even greater extent, Lazarfeld's \citeyearpar{Lazarsfeld1968} findings of socio-economically determined preferences, may no longer apply given widespread ignorance of voters.

%More generally, these findings cast doubt on the liberal assumption that an \emph{electoral} democracy with pre-social preferences and particularistic interest representation will achieve socially optimal decisions.

%\subsection{\emph{Rational Ignorance} to the Rescue}
%Theorists of Rational Choice respond to these doubts by pointing out that ignorance may well be rational, given how small a chance an individual vote stands to turn the election (particularly under SMP) \citep{Olson-1971-aa}, and that largely ignorant masses can still produce socially optimal outcomes if their errors are random \citep{Page1993, Surowiecki2004}.

%While I find the pride, that evangelists of Rational Choice take in the Olsonian escape from participation quite dubious, a broader appraisal of the merits and problems of Rational Choice is beyond the scope of this piece.

%It will suffice to accept their framework of human motivation and to simply question the empirical validity of the ``Wisdom of Crowds''.
%This argument presented by a host of authors (see above), and recently popularized by \cite{Surowiecki2004} proceeds as follows:
%if all those ignorant voters cancel each other out in their \emph{random} aberations from the socially optimal, the remaining, knowledgeable voters will decide the election, as \emph{their} choices will differ \emph{systematically} from the mean.

%\subsection{What if Errors are Systematic?}
%Bryan \cite{Caplan2007} has recently provided ample evidence and a compelling framework to cast doubt on this assumption.
%In his passionate dismantling of ``The Myth of the Rational Voter'', he describes how uneducated opinions on economic matters will \emph{systematically} differ from the average, following what he describes as an \emph{antimarket}, \emph{antiforeign}, \emph{make-work} and \emph{pessimistic} bias.

%If \citeauthor{Caplan2007} is right, and voters do in fact err systematically on matters which they understand inadequately, there will be no Wisdom of the Crowds, but instead a tyranny of the biased masses.

%\subsection{What if the Value Space is \emph{N}-Dimensional?}
%Another set of empirical finding incompatible with \cite{Downs-1957-aa} assumption comes from political sociology, where an entire field of sophisticated surveys and competing theories has evolved, probing into the dimensionality and change of the postindustrial value space.

%It will suffice to point to one set of findings here.
%In their work, \cite{InglehartWelzel-2005-aa} not only single-handedly integrate value change into a reanimated version of modernization theory, they also provide a host of empirical findings from the World Values Surveys, showing that, at the least, the value space is now two-dimensional, with an axis of traditional vs.\ secular-rational values, and a second axis of survival vs.\ self-expression values.
%The authors describe a wide-reaching change in direction, from the former pre-modern to modern dimension to the latter modern to postmodern dimension, but note that this is neither an irreversible nor universal process and that in any given society, people will differ on more than one dimension.
%Other, broadly corroborating findings come from \cite{FlanaganLee-2003-aa}, who explicitly relates value change to a complication in political competition and \cite{Schwartz-1994-ab}, who suggests a whole circle\footnote{The problem of visualizing more than two dimensions in a \emph{circle} is duly noted.
%From statistical work for Chris Welzel, this author can attest to the apparent necessity to (overly) simplify empirical findings of the value space until they are readily presentable in two-dimensional form.
%Such multidimensional scaling and forced factor analyses at almost all cost in terms of model fit, to the author, indeed appears to be a troubling habit of value research.} of independent dimensions.

%\subsection{Problems with Downs}
%From these empirical findings and conceptual refinements arise a number of potential incompatibilities with Downs model of political competition and antecedent, optimistic ideas of socially optimal public choice under pluralist democracy:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{A substantial subset of voters appears to harbor irrational, and systematically skewed beliefs.
%A simple aggregation of preferences appears unlikely to result in socially optimal policies.}
%	\item{Any given postindustrial electorate is likely to differ on more than one dimension in their political preferences.}
%\end{enumerate}

%These incompatibilities alone, albeit preliminary in nature, would require a thorough rethinking of pluralist prescriptions and analyses of liberal, representative democracy undergoing Downsian aggregation.

%\section{Messing with the Supply Side of Democracy ---\\A Theory of Dysfunctional Political Competition for Dealigned and Irrational Voters}

%\begin{quote}
%	\emph{I'm a little angry that I apparently was voting in a completely different election than most of the country.
%I thought we were having a rational discussion about how best to protect ourselves in perilous times ---\\ and actually, it was a referendum on boys kissing.}\\\\
%	Comedian Bill Maher on his HBO special ``I'm Swiss'', referring to the 2004 U.S.\ presidential election.
%\end{quote}

%Speaking in economic terms, the preceding section dealt with questions regarding the \emph{demand side} of \citeauthor{Downs-1957-aa}'s \citeyear{Downs-1957-aa} ``Economic Theory of Democracy'':
%the condition and abilities of voters.

%In the following, I want to direct the view to the \emph{supply side} of political competition:
%to the parties and candidates that compete for majorities and to the campaigns they wage.

%\subsection{A Neo-Downsian Theory of Dysfunctional Political Competition}

%To hypothesize a Neo-Downsian Theory of Dysfunctional Political Competition, accounting for and problematizing the above described dynamics in political campaigning, I add to \cite{Downs-1957-aa} model specification the following:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{Voters differ in their preferences on a number of mutually orthogonal dimensions.}
%	\item{Voters differ in the importance they assign to different dimensions.}
%	\item{Voters differ in the importance they assign to positions \emph{along} one dimension.}
%	\item{Parties can choose which dimension(s) to campaign on.
%No agreement on dimensions is necessary.}
%	\item{Campaigning is costly.}
%	\item{Costs are the financial and otherwise efforts required to activate or convince a voter of any party given position on any given dimension.}
%	\item{Dimensions have different cost functions.}
%	\item{Cost functions are allowed to take any form, independent from the preference distribution, and including skewed and/or multimodal.
%(See \autoref{fig:Neodowns})}
%	\item{Parties aim to maximize their utility function, where marginal costs of campaigning are same as marginal vote increases.}
%\end{enumerate}

%\begin{figure}
%	\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{NeoDowns}
%\label{fig:Neodowns}
%\caption{The Median Voter (Downs 1957:
%118), with an inverse cost function overlaid.
%For more intuitive appeal, the overlaid function is \emph{not} the cost function, but the propensity of voters at the given position to be activated or convinced by a campaign.}
%\end{figure}

%It is unfortunately beyond my abilities to completely visualize the multidimensional model specified in the above, which would also have to be fully specified in formal math for further elaboration.

%For illustration, I have merely overlaid a hypothetical cost functions to Downs classic graph in \autoref{fig:Neodowns}.

%\paragraph{Introducing Variable Costs of Campaigning} It is first assumed that voters do in fact, vary in their preferences on more than one dimension.
%The number of, and potential correlations between dimensions (making them less than completely orthogonal in a multidimensional scaling) is of no concern here.
%Furthermore, the costs and rewards of campaigning are overlaid on Downs model.
% It is assumed that the effort required to activate (GOTV) or convince a voter vary as a function of her position on the chosen dimension.
%It is furthermore assumed that these cost functions differ in their overall integral as well as their shape:
%some dimensions are cheaper to campaign on overall, and some positions on some dimensions are easier to communicate than others.

%The above model specifications also allow voter preferences to vary in importance \emph{across} different and \emph{along} single dimensions.
%It is assumed here that these differences in assigned importance of voters are fully captured in the cost functions of the parties.
%This is a reasonable simplification:
%voters will be more easily (and cheaply) activated on positions and/or dimensions they already feel strongly about.

%\paragraph{How Will Parties Act} The incentives for parties to act are then substantially complicated.
%They will no longer, as \cite{Downs-1957-aa} assumed, simply compete for a vote share around some mode in the unidimensional preference distribution.
%Instead, given their budget constraint, they will choose their positions on, and dimensions they compete on, as a function of their campaigning costs and the chances to activate or convince a voter.
%In simple terms:
%they will campaign so as to maximize the ballot bang for their buck.

%From these incentives then emerges a rationale to choose positions \emph{between} preference distribution modes (the classical Median Voter prescription) and nereby, \emph{local} minima in the cost of campaigning function, or conversely, \emph{local} maxima of importance assigned by voters.

%Parties will multiply the ex-ante preference distribution with the costs of campaigning function and solve for that position that offers the best ratio of votes for campaign money invested.
%Exogenous budget constraints of parties may further alter this calculation.

%\paragraph{Introducing Strategic interaction}
%Choosing party platforms, and campaign positions is of course, as \cite{Downs-1957-aa} pointed out, a \emph{strategic interaction}, or simply:
%a game.
%The rationale of one party to choose a position depends, amongst other things, on the chosen positions and dimensions of all competing parties.

%This further complicates party incentives.
%As parties in an election --- per definition --- care about \emph{relative} payoffs, rather than \emph{absolute} payoffs, they will choose positions and dimensions, which, based on the real or anticipated campaigning of competing parties, will offer them the relatively highest ballot bang for the available campaign buck.

%\subsection{Different Dimensions for Different Voters}
%\paragraph{Converse, Redux:
%A Sweet Spot for Dumb Voters?}
%This model becomes more tangible and persuasive when interpreted in light of \citeauthor{Converse-1970-aa}'s \citeyearpar{Converse-1970-aa} insights.
%His subset of ``random'' voters appears to be more likely to be easily swayed by campaigns on dimensions \emph{different} from the mainstream of political competition than those ``systematic'' voters who held reliable, and potentially educated beliefs on the relative role of government and the market.

%Without conceptually stretching Converse's finding too far, they can at minimum be interpreted as support for the model's specification that different groups of people can relate with different ease and reliability to different dimensions.
%In political campaigning, that ease and reliability translates into campaign spending required to harvest voters.

%Converse's staple item on the relative roles of government and the market, appears to be a suitable dimension to appeal to some, educated voters who will \emph{systematically} respond to positions taken by competing parties.
%Other voters, who have displayed \emph{randomly} changing attitudes on the subject matter are unlikely to be reliably activated or persuaded by campaigns on this dimension.
%For them, in particular, other dimensions unbeknownst to Converse may be more suitable.

%Note also that the second, uneducated group of voters may be \emph{per se} more interesting to political campaigns:
%with relatively less developed political attitudes, and party alignment they constitute a battle ground where potentially, with the right, effective dimensions chosen, many more votes are at stake for political campaigns.
%By contrast, the group of educated voters with systematic and stable responses on the government-market dimension may be hard to win over, and relatively ineffective to mobilize given the typically higher turnout among these voters.

%In the language of the proposed model, the first, uneducated groups may provide a number of dimensions on which cost functions have a relatively small integral, or provide concentrated, ``sweet spots'' where a large number of voters can be reached with little effort.
%Put provocatively, dumb voters may just provide parties with more bang for the buck.

%\paragraph{False Class Consciousness, Redux:
%Screwing \emph{Joe the Plumber}}\footnote{No pun intended.}

%\begin{quote}
%	\emph{It's not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them, or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.}\\\\
%	Barack H.~Obama at a closed-door fundraiser in 2008, referring to the economically disadvantaged, sparking off the ``Bittergate'' controversy.
%\end{quote}

%While Barack Obama's comment in the 2008 primaries may be regarded as strategically unwise, it's sociological intuition does point to more worrisome implications of the above-mentioned dynamics.
%Political sophistication, like education in general, of course tends to correlate with socio-economic status.
%Richer, better-off people tend to have more systematic political attitudes and more knowledge of policy and process.

%I does not take a Marxist view of class or history to understand that this correlation, taken together with the greater and cheaper electoral benefits that relatively uneducated voters stand to offer, may blanket out from the political competition the interests of the underprivileged.

%\emph{Joe the Plumber}, who during the 2008 campaign criticized Barack Obama's tax cuts as being ``socialist'' and erroneously believed that he himself were to be disadvantaged by Obama's plan, is now a proverbial shorthand for screwing the poor in discourse and campaigning.

%The above model hypothesizes a compelling dynamic that could explain the systematic errors of attribution of their misfortune, to which Joe the Plumber and bitter Rust Belters fall prey.
%It may just be cheaper for parties to appeal to gun ownership, anti-foreign sentiment and religiosity rather than address head-on the economic condition of these unsystematic voters, whose redistributive repercussions, in turn, may alienate other, more systematic and richer voters.

%Moreover, and without a historical-materialist conspiracy theory in mind, a critical analysis must ask whom this dynamic benefits in the broader socio-economic scheme of things.

%\subsection{A Race to the Bottom of Impoverished Politics}

%\paragraph{Some Speculation, Some Informed Intuitions}
%Granted, much of the above critical application of an hypothesized neo-Downsian theory of dysfunctional political competition is in the realm of speculation, and far outstretches the empirical findings of \cite{Converse-1970-aa} and others.

%Particularly the concern about a possibly resultant socio-economic uncoupling belongs into the realm of empirical testing, not self-righteous certainty.

%And yet, some informed intuitions remain uncomfortably plausible.
%If voters do indeed differ in the degree of their political sophistication, then those relatively uneducated voters may provide parties with a fruitful battle ground, if on different dimensions.

%What are these dimensions going to be all about?
%By definition, they will try to persuade and mobilize voters on preference spaces and positions that are relatively easy to communicate and understand.

%\paragraph{Cooperation Problem on the High Road}
%There remain little reason why these easily communicated dimensions should then retain any meaningful relation to the true \emph{Public Choices} of our common polities.
%A political competition on preferences remote to the actual policy alternatives ahead, is, in fact, reasonably unlikely to foster the common good, as pluralist and liberal theorists of democracy had hoped.

%What could emerge, is a \emph{Prisoner's Dilemma} game between parties and our wider polity, where going the easy, cheap and low road, is always a dominant strategy, given the broader and more concentrated benefits that it provides vis-a-vis the widely distributed costs of socially suboptimal policy.
%The payoff matrix of such a Prisoner's Dilemma with approximate strategic choices is reproduced in \autoref{tab:BottomRace}.
%It includes, for illustration, examples policies easy to communicate for the Republicans and Democrats, compared to payoffs for a political competition on ``alternative conceptions of the common good'' (\citealt{Cohen-1989-aa}:
%23)\footnote{This payoff matrix is not a well-defined model of a strategic interaction, but rather an illustration of an intuited race to the bottom dynamic.
%In its complete strategic form, the payoff matrix would have to account for a greater number or different specification of players, where the costs of socially suboptimal policy are accrued not to the parties, but, as they are in fact, to the entire population.}.

%\subsection{Past and Current Conditions of Public Choice and Socio-Economic Structure}
%Comparing this model to the foil of late-modern political competition documented by \cite{Lazarsfeld1968}, one vexing question arises:
%why would political competition have been any less dysfunctional in the 1940s than today?

%Surely, voters were no more --- probably a lot less --- sophisticated than today, and parties were as self-interested as ever.
%And yet, from the almost idyllic account of Erie County, OH, emerges the idea of a somewhat functional political competition between Roosevelt and Willkie.

%One must be careful not to idealize the past, and in particular, the politics of the 1940s.
%These were, as described in the above, seemingly idyllic, but also times of suppression, unquestioned authority, tradition and unyielding socio-economic division, all overcome today.

%What makes Roosevelt vs.\ Willkie a fairer fight, even given its ``proto-democratic'' playing field, is that the policy alternatives of the day were sufficiently crude so as to be easily, and cheaply communicated.
%As \citeauthor{Lazarsfeld1968} (\citeyear{Lazarsfeld1968}:
%28) chronicle:
%\begin{quote}\emph{A very large majority of \textbf{both} groups thought that it would be the common man, the plain people, the working class, who would benefit if Roosevelt were elected.
%Both groups also agreed, although not to the same extent, that Willkie's victory would be best for the business class}.
%\end{quote}

%At the time, as \cite{LipsetRokkan-1967-aa} describe, this capital-labor cleavage was indeed still the dominant socio-economic fault line.
%Surely, other issues, such as U.S.\ intervention in the war and the respective fitness for office of the candidates were also important --- and arguably much harder to decide.
%But still, one preference dimension at least remained on which people could easily, and appropriately locate.
%For at the time, redistributive interventions (New Deal, worker rights, progressive income tax) in the mass late-industrial bifurcation of ownership of the means of production, were in fact predominant, and \emph{real} Public Choices.

%In game theoretic terms, campaigning on late-industrialist redistribution was a \emph{dominant} strategy, which, because it was so cheap to communicate and resonated so well, would pay, no matter what the other party did.

%Today, I argue, the Public Choices and socio-economic structures of a postindustrial economy are much too complex to be easily communicated.
%Redistributive alternatives, or, more topically, questions of \emph{equal opportunity} remain, to be sure.
%But in a time of widespread ownership of the means of production (think:\ private insurance, pensions) and increasing international competition (think:\ offshoring), answers are more complicated.

%These are questions on which even professional economists can reasonably disagree on, as the common adage goes, and surely, communicating their vexing complexity is no easy business for a campaigner --- especially, when the opponent takes the low road.

%The redistributive positions and dimensions that \emph{are} campaigned on by todays parties are so obviously misleading in their empty sloganeering that not even the faintest relation to substantive policy, let alone socio-economic interests of voters can be ascertained.

%To name just a few from recent German debates and campaigns:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{Is a smaller net/gross tax gap really good for everyone, when the balance is paid through an increasing (degressive) VAT?}
%	\item{Is a minimum wage really good for the working poor and unemployed people if it risks greater unemployment?}
%	\item{Is a cash-for-clunkers scheme really good for the environment and the broader economy?}
%\end{enumerate}

%In fact, just from a cursory evaluation of these, and many other widely communicated policies, it appears that their greatest merit may lie in their very simplicity and intuitive feel --- and not so much their quality and appropriateness.

%This is now the very condition of a globalized, postindustrial economy and society, where individual life chances and the collective good are determined by complex, mutually reinforcing, often non-linear causalities, with ever greater interdependencies between the parts and the whole.

%To this world, it appears, a political competition between self-interested parties, following dominant strategies to campaign on the cheapest dimension available, is a uniquely poor match.

%\section{A Reality Check:
%Political Campaigning Today}
%Changes in the available technologies and methods for political campaigns are of course another corollary of that complexly interacting, and ever progressing world.
%These very innovations of political campaigning could be understood as enabling a dysfunctional race to the bottom.

%In the following, I list and critically evaluate recent developments in campaigning in the light of an hypothesized theory of neo-Downsian political competition.

%\subsection{Accounts of Changing Political Campaigning}
%\subsubsection{Deconstructing the Hype}
%A vague air of dysfunction much in line with the hypothesized dynamic presented in the above emerges, for example, from \citeauthor{Louw2005}'s \citeyearpar{Louw2005} account of ``The Media and Political Process''.
%He warns that we increasingly inhabit a world of secondhand, (mediated) images which we naturalize as `the way things are'.
%In classic constructivist manner, he asks to `de-naturalize' these image, and render visible the conditions and rationales of their production.
%While more concerned with the highly professionalized scripting (or constructing) of hypes, Louw's culture pessimism of the constructivist kind can also be construed (no pun intended) as a critique of competing on easily communicated dimensions:
%\begin{quote}\emph{Those scripting hype politics are concerned with agenda setting --- i.e.\ trying to direct the gaze of the public away from issues that might prove problematic for policy makers, and directing their gaze towards issues deemed helpful for steering society in the direction desired by policy elites.}
%(\citealt{Louw2005}:
%274)
%\end{quote}

%Constructivists have long described the efforts of \emph{identity entrepreneurs} --- or issue entrepreneurs -- as a self-interested project of constructing meaning \citep{Brubaker-2002-aa}.
%Borrowing \citeauthor{Weber-1918-aa}'s \citeyearpar{Weber-1918-aa} classic adage, these entrepreneurs live \emph{for} as well as \emph{off} the issues and identities they construct.
%In the proposed neo-Downsian theory of dysfunctional political competition, much the same can be said of self-interested parties, choosing and testing positions and preference dimensions.

%\subsubsection{Issues are Non-Issues}
%The recently evolving literature of \emph{issue-based} campaigning, properly re-interpreted also provides some support for the hypothesized neo-Downsian dynamic.
%The theory specified here, however, also suggests that this field of research should denaturalize its concepts and should adopt a fundamentally more critical perspective.

%Quite trivially, \cite{Abbe2003} report that voters are more likely to support candidates and parties with whom they agree on the importance of issues, for example centering a campaign on either restoring moral and ethical standards (Republican owned) or improving education (Democratic owned).
%They conclude from their analysis of staffer-reported campaign issues and vote shares in the 1998 U.S.\ House of Representatives election that issues are superseding socio-economic status, and almost happily advise that candidates ``dominating the issue agenda enjoy important advantages at the polls'' (\citeyear[428]{Abbe2003}).

%\citeauthor{Abbe2003}'s \citeyearpar{Abbe2003} work on issue voting is fraught with a number of troubling misconceptions.

%Most importantly, they naturalize the list of issues presented to them uncritically, and make the campaign staffer sloganeering on ``education, social security, taxes, the economy, health care and moral/ethical standards'' (\emph{ibid.}:
%421) part of their analytical toolkit.
%You do not have to be a hardcore constructivist to endorse its lesson that such concepts are indeed ``what we want to explain, not what we want to explain things \emph{with}'' \citep[165]{Brubaker-2002-aa}, emphasis in original).
%In fact, one would expect that it does not take more than common sense and a critical mind to recognize that ``education'' vs.\ ``taxes'' are not \emph{real} policy alternatives, on which \emph{any} real political competition could, let alone \emph{should} be waged --- if only for the obvious point that public education \emph{requires} taxation.

%At the least, when all their sloganeering-gone-science is done, \cite{Abbe2003} should deconstruct the issues presented into the ideological alternatives that underly them:
%a belief that ``the economy'' is a more important issue than ``education'' \emph{does} embody an ideological --- if unsophisticated --- predisposition to place more emphasis on the market and material values, rather than typically public and emancipating education.
%Were \citeauthor{Abbe2003} honest, they would concede that even their data bears out this conclusion that \emph{really, issues are non-issues}:
%the conditional probability for a voter to vote republican with shared issue priorities (.17) is --- hardly coincidentally --- the same as the respective coefficient for republican ideology (.18) (\emph{ibid.}:
%425).

%The flawed reasoning on ``issue'' campaigns becomes apparent when you consider ``social security''.
%That a republican candidate is unable, as they show, to successfully campaign on this issue to voters who prioritize it, has obviously little to do with any sort of ``ownership'' of the issue:
%it is just that Republicans happen to be widely known to wish to \emph{cut} social security, an agenda that is unlikely to be popular with people who think of these government programs as important.
%In short, there \emph{is} no successful way for a Republican to campaign on social security, not because he lacks ownership, but because this \emph{issue} is in fact a \emph{preference}, and one that Republicans do not share.

%Latently affirmative of the changes they chronicle, \citeauthor{Abbe2003} should remake their work on issues into critical analyses of these foul tricks to remake the political and social world into a world of choices that really do not exist.

%Likewise, theoretically lightweight as their present work is, they should set out to explain how and under which circumstances campaigns are able to discursively establish these pseudo-choices and priorities, an attempt that will likely lead them to the more fruitful framework of Agenda Setting.

%\subsubsection{Innovations in Campaigning}

%\paragraph{Professional Campaigns}
%\cite{Gibson2001} provide a succinct analytical integration and party-centered explanation of the changing nature of political campaigning.
%Like others in the field, they see three stages in the development of political campaigns, with the recent transformation towards \emph{professional campaigns}, that are elsewhere referred to as \emph{post-modern} or \emph{Americanized} campaigns.
%These new campaigns share their use of modern information and communication technology (including automated analytics and messaging technologies), are generally expensive, continuous and neatly targeted in their efforts, with a strong national center\footnote{Local chapters are however able to carve out some degree of independence, and may launch their own professional campaigns, as \cite{Strachan} describes.}.

%In accordance with the framework suggested here, \cite{Farrell2000} describe professional campaigns as changing from catch-all to a market-segmentation approach and \citeauthor{Gibson2001} \citeyearpar[32]{Gibson2001} point out that:
%\begin{quote}\emph{Voters are seen more as consumers than loyal partisans, to be wooed with sophisticated advertising rather than serious political education.}
%\end{quote}

%Professional campaigns should not be thrown out like the proverbial baby with the bathwater.
%Their power to organize communication in large and functionally differentiated societies is  a blessing --- when put to use responsibly.
%Deploring mediatization, as some of \citeauthor{Strachan}'s (\citeyear[72]{Strachan}) protagonists do, is besides the point.
%In a modern, functionally differentiated society (``mass'' being a redundant qualifier), facing a multitude of complex public choices, some degree of specialization and mediatized communication is of the essence.

%And yet it also carries within it the organizational and technological seeds enabling a neo-Downsian race down to the lowest discursive denominator and is deeply embedded in this dynamic.

%\cite{Gibson2001} may understate and misconceive the role of parties in the emergence of professional campaigning, when they only point to increased education of the electorate, newly available communications technology and regulatory changes, tipped by recent electoral defeats and internal power struggles.
%Rather, it is suggested here, professional campaigns should be understood as (dominant) strategies adopted by parties, seeking to maximize their ballot bang for the campaigning buck, in a complex world of partly unsophisticated voters, who can no longer be activated or convinced on a single or simple preference dimension.

%When professional campaigning is in fact found to serve this purpose, we must turn our analytical attention to the \emph{interaction} and \emph{interdependence} of organizational and technological innovations and the degenerate political competition they serve to target, script and optimize.
%We must then describe and criticize professional campaigns as what they are:
%a dysfunction.

%\paragraph{Technology is Epiphenomenal}
%A prominent theme in the literature on professional campaigns is technological innovation, particularly web-based products and services.
%As awe-inspiring as these technologies are, they are, as such, as epiphenomenal as the shift from black-and-white to color TV.

%\cite{Gueorguieva2007} provides an instructive example of the dangers of a-theoretical technological determinism and hype.
%When she describes how a democratic campaigner was staffed to record public appearances of the republican opponent and upload borderline racist ``mishaps'' onto YouTube, with subsequent outrage and wide popularity, it is not clear at all what the substantive contribution of YouTube as a medium is.
%Clearly, any local cable station or even network, would have gladly accepted the same footage, and brought it to a wide audience by much of the same logic that said inflammatory material garnered popularity in YouTube.
%Genuinely excited, \citeauthor{Gueorguieva2007} really seems to believe that YouTube ``provides free and broad dissemination of campaign messages and ads, thus affecting the campaign budget'' and that ``its nearly 20 million unique visitors per month are also a considerable audience'' (293).
%She fails to note that visitors on YouTube --- which also is \emph{not}, as she claims, a \emph{social network} --- are not \emph{all} exposed to \emph{all} the footage uploaded, but that views are widely dispersed, and that six-digit views for any \emph{single} video are exceedingly rare and hard to achieve.
%The much more relevant dysfunction of campaigning based on verbal mishaps of one's opponent appears to be amiss to her.

%Much of the excitement and, more often than not, misconceived \emph{namedropping}, should be replaced by a theoretically integrated argument explaining \emph{why} and \emph{how} exactly this new technology matters.
%Surely, these technologies appear likely to allow for much greater individualization, targeting and new forms of interaction --- but a mere \emph{restating} of that question, with a few Web 2.0-references thrown in for good measure is not quite yet social \emph{science}.

%Following the framework suggested herein, technological innovations must be investigated in terms of them enabling parties to gather intelligence on, and compete on more preference dimensions and optimize their dominant strategy of ballot bang for the campaign buck.

%\paragraph{From the Evil Campaign Strategist's Cookbook}
%Clear and unabashed support for a neo-Downsian theory of dysfunctional political competition --- while unbeknownst to him --- comes from \cite{Malchow2003}, providing hands-on advice how to maximize your ballot bang for the campaign buck in his handbook on ``The New Political Targeting''.

%Right in line with the above model specification that parties care about the ballot bang/campaign buck ratio, he shamelessly admits that ``The task of the campaign strategist is to find the easiest path to victory'' (\emph{ibid.}:
%9) and advises to ``spend your money where you get the most value'' (\emph{ibid.}:
%256).

%He is also outspoken with regard to the dimensions and preferences that will work best:
%\begin{quote} \emph{Compared to gun control and abortion rights, the environment is a weakling of an issue.
%(\ldots).
%(There,) the devil is in the details and voters don't like details.} (\emph{ibid.}:
%201).
%\end{quote}
%He goes on to describe how powerfully and easily gun control can be employed to mobilize\footnote{He also notes how, in a uniquely perverse irony of history, increasing gun registration legislation has generated databases that allow pro-gun campaigners to target and mobilize their sympathizers effectively.}:
%\begin{quote} \emph{Gun control has been an important factor in deciding the outcome of many elections --- usually by defeating the pro-gun control candidate.
%While broad majorities in most states support gun control laws, those opposed to gun control are more energized and ready to vote for their guns.
%The ability of the National Rifle Association and other gun-owner organizations to find and mobilize
%their supporters has become a powerful force in politics and has given the gun lobby clout far in excess of its public support} (\emph{ibid.}:
%198).
%\end{quote}

%These cynical admissions of a campaign strategist corroborate the suggested neo-Downsian theory in a number of ways:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{Professional campaigns maximize vote share for the buck.}
%	\item{Professional campaigns choose and pick dimensions and positions on which to campaign strategically.}
%	\item{The cost function to mobilize or convince voters is independent of the overall, underlying preference distribution:
%in this case, the nutbar ``pickups and shotguns'' guys (an official type from Malchow's book, \emph{ibid.:
%10}) rule the day, not because they are many, but because they are easily committed.}
%	\item{Campaigns are willing and able to choose supposedly socially suboptimal positions (pro-gun), independent of the median voter's position (anti-gun), and on a dimension (gun control) arguably somewhat secondary in importance.}
%\end{enumerate}

%In a revealing choice of words, \cite{Malchow2003} also supports the supply-side view that this theory adopts, and casts into doubt any hopes for voter empowerment by dealignment and individualization when he describes his trade as one of ``harvesting voters'' (\emph{ibid.}:
%10).

%\subsection{There is no Conspiracy}
%Democratic governance has met its enemy:
%it is us, when we heed the temptations of strategic campaigning.
%And yet, even after peeking into \citeauthor{Malchow2003}'s cookbook, some cautionary notes against conspiracy theorizing are required.

%As \cite{Louw2005} reminds us in classic pluralist fashion, even insiders are no conspirators:
%they are many, they compete, and they are in factions.
%More often than not, attempts to seize power by discursive manipulation of the strategic kind fail.
%As \cite{Hall1980} has forcefully argued:
%encoding and decoding are complex processes, and they are imperfectly understood and anticipated by would-be manipulators.

%\subsection{Strategic Interaction under Agenda Setting}
%I will introduce one further complication to the above model by relating to the theory of Agenda Setting, a frequent topos in the campaigning literature, aptly summarized as `not telling you what to think, but what to think \emph{about}' \citep{McQuail-2000-aa}.

%To model agenda setting in the context of the theory suggested here, model specification four has to be altered:
%when agenda setting matters, parties \emph{cannot independently} choose dimensions to campaign on, they are instead limited in their choice by whomever moves first, or more effectively.
%In line with this specification, \cite{Farrell2002} note that there are ``conscious attempts to set the agenda and define the terms of public debate''.

%On the other hand, it appears unlikely to assume that the agenda setter can impose any issues or dimensions on other players.

%Agenda setting under a neo-Downsian theory of dysfunctional political competition then appears as a veto player problem \citep{Tsebelis-2002-aa}, where first movers or powerful agenda setters can exert undue influence on the consensually agreed-upon dimension(s) of campaigning by anticipating other players indifference curves, and pre-empting other players moves.

%A full adaptation and specification of Tsebelis is unfortunately beyond the scope of this piece, but will surely be a worthwhile endeavour.

%\section{The Only Fix:
%Deliberation on the Common Good}

%\subsection{Avenues and Imperatives for Further Research}

%\paragraph{Lots of Questions Asked} Surely, all of the above presented is but an hypothesis awaiting empirical tests, albeit a plausible one.
%Key empirical questions include:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item{Does political sophistication vary with socio-economic status?}
%	\item{Do political parties choose campaign dimensions and positions based on costs of convincing and mobilizing, when other positions closer to the median voter are available?}
%	\item{Do qualitative interviews with campaign strategists corroborate the dynamics of political competition presented herein?}
%	\item{Are chosen campaign dimensions and positions systematically of subordinate importance, or tend to obscure redistributive issues?}
%\end{enumerate}

%\paragraph{No Benefit of the Doubt}And yet, when a dysfunctional political competition of the neo-Downsian kind can be made plausible, or even just from a cursory inspection of today's political debates:
%in a critical social science, there can be no \emph{benefit of the doubt} for professionalized, targeted and strategic campaigning.

%\paragraph{Theory, no Post-isms} The study of post-modern campaigns, as it is with all the \emph{post-isms}, must not settle for a vague sense of something being \emph{past}.
%Instead, it must explain what dynamic replaces the old one, and theorize the process of social change at work.

%This is not what \citeauthor{Abbe2003} do when they act as disinterested bookkeepers of a fundamentally dysfunctional political competition.
%This is not what \cite{McAllister2002} does when he lightheartedly reports on more ``calculating'' and ``capricious'' late deciders, ignoring entirely the question of whether these calculations make any sense.

%\paragraph{\href{http://maxheld.de/2009/10/13/setting-goalposts/}{Disinterested Just Doesn't Cut it Anymore}} The study of professional campaigning has to achieve more than a-theoretical, empiricist, uncritical and latently \emph{affirmative} accounts of the status quo.
%\cite{Farrell2002} miss an important point when they merely ask:
%``Do Political Campaigns Matter''?

%Instead, the question ought to be:
%what is the level of debate at which these stalemates are reached, issues are chosen and voters are targeted?
%Are we likely to see socially optimal and equitable policies emerge from this political competition?
%And if not, why not --- and what can be done about it?

%\end{quote}

%\paragraph{R.I.P., Pluralism} It would appear from this neo-Downsian theory of dysfunctional political communication that the pluralist idea of liberal democracy has failed, on empirical grounds:
%``there is no active citizenry'' (\citealt{Louw2005}:
%15).

%Or rather, I would add, there is no citizenry with sufficiently sophisticated political beliefs ex ante, and no political movement willing to do anything about it.
%Instead, professionalized, targeted campaigning allows parties to exploit this very inadequacy, and to put on a decent horse-race show, for good measure.
%Strategic campaigning and the race to the bottom it gives rise to are the last nails to pluralism's coffin.

%\paragraph{My Brother's Keeper / My Sister's Keeper}
%So, what to do?
%How to reform and reinvigorate political competition in a world to complex for any one citizen to master?

%To make that marketplace of ideas fair and real again, in hopes for socially optimal and equitable outcomes, we have to move toward deliberative democracy as best we can.

%A deliberative ideal of democracy does away with \emph{all} pre-socially formed beliefs and attitudes, and puts it all up for a fair, and common-spirited debate.
%It is not a totalitarian democracy of the Rousseauian kind --- it allows for, and encourages \emph{alternative} conceptions of the common good \citep{Elster-1998-aa, Cohen-1989-aa}.
%For it to work, the very opposite of pluralism, a sense of ``Justice as Fairness'', has to prevail, where only arguments are permissible that assume away knowledge of one's own position in society, under a veil of ignorance \citep{Rawls-1971}.

%And so, rather than speaking for yourself, a good argument will always speak to the common good, and remind us of that biblical command, to \emph{be our brothers' and sisters' keepers}, whatever their political sophistication and socio-economic status.

%\paragraph{Starting Here, Step by Step}
%So, how do we get there, to that mythical land of deliberative democracy, which, admittedly, exists largely in abstraction?

%Real reform starts in the here and now, and evolves towards that more perfect union from the status quo.

%For us, the status quo are mass political organizations, orchestrating mediated campaigns, waged on millions of often ill-prepared citizens.
%There is no near-term option to do overcome this functional differentiation, if there ever will be.
%And an unequally sophisticated electorate is here to stay, for our lifetimes at least.

%So we must pioneer an ugly hybrid:
%the \emph{deliberative campaign}, mediated and professional.
%We must resist the temptation to choose and pick the easiest way to a voter's cross, and instead be assiduous in our explaining, convincing, empowering and engaging ourselves, on to those \emph{real} public choices that we face.
%\emph{Those} public choices that are complex, even to the expert and seemingly inaccessible for the everyday voter.
%\emph{Those} public choices that matter so urgently, but the public choices, which, to translate into the experiences of everyday, and the opportunities of everyone, we must craft a whole new language.

%There remains hope that once given an honest chance, we, as voters will hear the difference in tone, and no longer fall for the dirty tricks.

%There remains the promise and the duty, that:

%It is easily lost, but never finally won.}\\\\
%William Hastie (1904 -- 1976), first African-American Supreme Court Justice.
%\end{quote}



%different types of issues:
%For once, the issues that are represented in unconventional forms of participation are different from those of other modes.
%Typically, these organizations make protest demands, following a negative logic (“against”, “stop” …) and they maintain “at best rudimentary (…) platforms” (Offe 1985:
%829).
%Their claims are not part of an encompassing agenda, but are non-negotiable single issues.
%Consequently, unconventional modes of participation do not have to face trade-offs between goods, and are structurally incapable of bargaining, compromise and issue-linkages.
%While this is an effective strategy to mobilize people and to communicate concerns, it is an incentive structure that distorts the political competition at the expense of political parties, possibly contributing to their legitimacy deficit.
%Additionally it is a political logic that is not in line with the limitations to the input aspects of democratic governance as stated above.
% I therefore believe it may be a lot too simple to say that merely the repertoire of political participation is changing (Welzel 2002b).

%The deliberative argument, as young says is "reason over power".
%(Young 1996:
%122).
%Now if you drop reason, too, you're left with nothing.
%She points out that deliberation so competition.
%No, no no.
%It's persuasion, whicha lways entails understanding the other persons circumstance.
%I am not even talking about the baad essentializing (male speaking, female speaking)

%The CoelhoPozzono 2005:
%181 account of participation in local health administration is insightful when it comes to the boundaries of involving people:
%"The dendecy of citizen representatives to construct their arguments in a way that is regarded as unstructured, combined with their focus on highly localized issues, makes their speeches appear unclear, emotional, disruptive or irrelevant to most representatives of the other sectors.
%Moreover, this style of speech tends to be associtaed with poorer and less educated people, and it is regarded as not only ineffective, but also virtually unintelligble". -->

### The Good Old Days

<!-- %\paragraph{Dealignment}
%When \citet{Lazarsfeld1968} went out to Erie County, OH in 1940 to figure out ``How the Voter Makes up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign'' they found that citizens voted in relatively socio-economically homogenous groups, that socio-economic status neatly predicted their voting behavior.
%Also, people would typically vote as their parents had, and swing- or late-deciding voters where relatively scarce.

%This has since changed dramatically.
%Party alignment as weaked, arguably both as a corellate of a broader disaffection with (mass) associations \citep{Putnam-1995-aa} as well as as a function of an unfolding value space, whose multiple dimensions two (or even multi-) party systems can no longer accomodate \citep{InglehartWelzel-2005-aa}.

%\paragraph{Individualization, Targeting of Voters}
%The second, not entirely disjunct trend is one of individualization \citep{Beck-2002-aa}.
%The lifestyle choices of people diversify, and become (at least superficially) more independent from socio-economic status.

%This sociological trend is part and parcel with the emergence of new means of production, that allow for customization of products and services.

%Also, advances in information technology allow for an ever greater degree of automatic capture and intelligent analyses of these increasing differences between people.
%In the ream of political campaigning, this is happening in targeted political advertising.

%As \citet{Malchow2003} describes in his handbook of political campaigning, modern technologies in analysis (ranging from the mundane correlation and regression to cutting-edge neural network modeling or data-mining) and information-\emph{narrow}casting (for example:
%from ZIP-code cable TV to bloc-specific mailings, or household-specific phone banking) allow professional campaigners to act on the increasing differentiation of lifestyles.
%Specifically, Malchow advocates that professional campaigners use as much available (seemingly unrelated) lifestyle and otherwise information to concentrate their efforts on those voters they are most likely to activate (for GOTV efforts), convince (for swing voters) or persuade (for supporters of the opposing party).

%\paragraph{Political Campaigning under Dealignment, Individualization}
%What does money spent in campaigns have to do with all of this?
%Simple:
%the above trends of party dealignment and individualization, in the current configuration of political competition \footnote{More on the arguably dysfunctional dynamic of the current configuration of political competition in my other assignment}, require intensive professionalization of campaign efforts (otherwise referred to as ``Americanized'' or post-modern campaigns), which in turn, is costly.

%Once this dynamic is set in motion, as \citet{Gibson2001} argue, typically by electoral defeats, followed by changes in internal leadership and a consolidation of power at the center, other competing parties have to follow suit.
%\citet{Strachan} observes this dynamic even at the grassroots-level of local campaigns, where alternative, low-budget, face-to-face campaigning was the norm until recently:
%``Jack didn't want to do the kinds of things candidates have to do.
%It's commendable to run a race on \$50,000, but when the opponent has \$400,000 he sets the rules, and that's what happened in this race''  (\citealt[72]{Strachan}).

%Professionalization, and with that, increasing spending of political campaigns, then emerges as a dominant strategy, speaking in terms of game theory:
%no matter what the other party does, you're always better off professionalizing.
%And low-budget campaign ``collusion'', while potentially Pareto and socially optimal (as is arguably the case at the municipal level), becomes a Prisoner's Dilemma of cooperation.

%\section{How does increasing campaign spending affect the political process?
%--- \\The normative debate}

%\paragraph{The Facts:
%Money Doesn't Seem to Buy Elections}
%Conventional, if cynical, wisdom holds that with increasing spending, money can buy elections.
%Empirical findings supporting that claim, however, are scarce.
%In a cleverly designed study, comparing repeat contestants (thereby controlling for a large share of candidate-inherent qualities) in U.S.\ House elections, \emph{rogue economist} \citet{Levitt1994} found no significant effect of campaign spending on electoral outcomes, controlling for a large number of other factors\footnote{Levitt, concerned with social welfare, however, concludes from this finding, that some cap on campaign spending would be beneficial, as results are unlikely to change and wasteful, irrational extravagance could be avoided.}.

%An intuition along these lines, doubting the measurable effectiveness of one's campaign and spending was also offered by Frank Stauss of the Berlin-based Butter agency in class, reflecting on the impact of the 2009 SPD federal campaign.

%\paragraph{The Path-Dependency of Professional, Expensive Campaigns ---\\ Leading to \emph{Hyper-Majoritarian} Democracy?}
%A methodological note of caution should be in order here.
%Levitt's, as much of the other research on the impact of campaign spending (and its antecedent professionalization) was based on majoritarian systems \citep{Lijphart-1999-aa} of governance in the Anglo-American world.
%With their single-member plurality electoral system (``First Past the Post'', FPTP), and its correlate two-party system, it appears reasonable to assume that most electoral contests would feature only two (reasonably feasible) candidates, who will relatively easily achieve some degree of media and otherwise exposure in their districts.
%Under proportional representation electoral systems (PR), where more parties compete not just for plurality seats, but for percentages of the popular vote, ex-ante exposure of candidates may be much more unequally distributed, with many of them marginalized.

%As Levitt implicitly concedes in his paper, fundraising is likely subject to great path dependencies and economies of scale:
%it is disproportionately easier to raise funds for a successful, well-known candidate than for other, less well-known contestants.
%Even in systems where all, or more of campaign spending is publicly funded (as in many European systems), a similar dynamic is conceivable.
%Also there, public funds depend on past performance at the polls, and, if campaign spending is to feature curvilinear effects, path dependencies could be at work.

%Taken together, the possibility of hyper-majoritarian competition in both consensus as well as majoritarian democracies arises, where few candidates (or issues, or parties) stand a chance at gaining some popular support, given how high the ``market entry costs'' are.
%Granted, however, the recent German trend for large parties to loose shares seems not to support such a dynamic.

%\paragraph{The Ties That a \$1000 Breakfast Plate Binds \ldots}
%More questions towards the legitimacy of high campaign spending, and, related, private fundraising remain.
%Even if Levitt is right as it seems, and private campaign donations are unable to buy elections, it is conceivable that, given the Prisoner's Dilemma of high-spending, donors may be able to exert undue influence on or at the least, access to office-holders.

%\section{Conclusion}

%I first conclude that private campaign donations should be outlawed, if only for the reason of \emph{suspected} undue influence.
%In all of the below, I refer to a scenario of high, but entirely publicly funded campaign expenditure.

%\paragraph{Campaign Spending and Trends in Representative Democracy:\\ Yes, It Is Inevitable}
%I conclude from the above, and the potential Prisoner's Dilemma-type competition between parties, as well as the broader trends of dealignment and individualization, to which professional, expensive campaigns respond, that indeed, higher campaign spendings are an inevitable outcome for all representative democracies.

%\paragraph{Campaign Spending and Voter Apathy}
%Going back to the aforementioned background trends and correllates of high campaign spending, party dealignment, and individualized targeting, given persistent if not increasing voter apathy I wonder whether really, the link with high campaign spending is a causal one.

%It could well be argued that voter apathy, possibly caused by dealignment and a misconfiguration of the political competition, is the independent variable to which frantic individualization and expensive professionalization of campaigns are merely dependent responses.

%But more importantly, I wonder whether increased campaign spending is not completely epiphenomenal to the potentially misaligned political competition, and related voter apathy.
%At least at the federal or state level, it appears inevitable that cheap, unmediated, face-to-face campaigning for representative democracy, is no option.
%As simple and reliable class voting patterns dealign and dissolve, previously instrumental to mass mobilization, more (financial) effort to communicate competing ideas is clearly necessary.

%Much rather, it seems possible that the slicing and dicing of the electorate into neatly defined groups, some (or many) responding strongly to their own (if relatively irrelevant or ill-defined) ``hot-button issues'' will lead to a political competition at the lowest, dysfunctional denominator.
%I try to explore how such a dynamic could work in the other assignment.

%I would then conclude that high campaign spending is not as such the problem for voter engagement, at least if realistic opportunities for entry are available to new contestants or ideas.
%With a publicly funded, regressive schedule of campaign finance (relatively less money for successful parties in the past, a sort of party ``infant-industry'' protection), and political competition about the \emph{true} alternatives (not ``issues'') of public policy, effectively communicated and exchanged, expensive campaigns should be considered a wise investment, not a frivolous extravagance.


%The crisis is not one of overload, that i expect Crozier, Huntington and Watanuki (1975) as cited in Warren 2003, but one of underresourcing.
%And in these questions you always have to think about the ideal, utopian hypothetical, which, sadly, we hardly ever do. -->



## Misunderstanding Tax

<!-- %John Steinbeck:
%Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires -->
<!-- above steinbeck quote is actually, for the most part, *not* the problem.
it's much deeper than just plain false class Consciousness
actually, that is *not* the emphasis here -->

<!-- ## The Detective Story of Income Taxation (Who Dunnit? Who killed progressivity?)

> "The real and pressingly practical question for tax is not whether to have an income or a consumption tax, but what form of consumption tax to have. The stakes in this battle are clear and dramatic: the fate of progressivity in tax lies in the balance."
> Edward J. McCaffery (2005: 817)

> "Advocates of redistributive taxes must wake up and realize that their end is in jeopardy on account of their poor choice of means: they are fighting, and losing, the wrong war."
> Edward J. McCaffery (2005: 848)

The political alternatives now seem to be between progressive income tax and prepaid proportional/flat consumption tax (VAT, Social Contributions, Payroll, all equivalent). This is an incomplete choice set.
The one progressive component of today's tax regimes, the personal income tax, has deficient backstops.
- Estate and gift taxes (buy, borrow, die)
- Corporate income tax (indeterminate incidence, no progression, indeterminate location of value generation)

The personal income tax as structural flaws, remaking the PIT ever more into a wage or prepaid consumption tax.
1. Macomber. Tax on accession/accrual or tax on realization? The Supreme Court rules: you can tax only on realization (selling).
 this problem is much exacerbated in the case of income in illiquid assets.
2. Tax Planning 101 aka Buy, Borrow, Die. Mrs Macomber could simply borrow on her (appreciating!) stock as collateral. Recall that borrowing, is not income under an income tax. Mrs Macomber can spend out of the borrowing tax-free.
3. Heirs never pay the estate tax, because that is (as it makes sense) a net tax on assets minus liabilities. In the extreme case of Tax Planning 101, there is no estate.
4. Also, Tax Planning 101 incentivizes people to never realize, to never sell. This may lead to markets freezing up and asset as well as derivatives (!) bubbles, at great cost to the economy. -->


## A Vicious Cycle

These two crises --- an ineffective and/or inefficient welfare state and a confused democracy --- may partly reinforce one another into one perfect storm of societal reaction by stealth:

> The two issues, the crisis of egalitarian politics and the trivialization of democracy, are not necessarily the same.
> Egalitarians might say that they do not care how manipulative of democracy a government is, provided it divides society's wealth and power more evenly.
> A conservative democrat will point out that improving the quality of political debate need not necessarily result in more redistributive policies.
> But at certain crucial points, the two issues do intersect [\ldots].
> My central contentions are that while the forms of democracy remain fully in place --- and today in some respects are actually strengthened --- politics and governments are increasingly slipping back into the control of privileged elites in the manner characteristic of pre-democratic times;
> and that one major consequence of this process is the growing impotence of egalitarian causes.

## Critique of the Literature

<!-- On that count, some of the literature falls short:
it fails to bring the @Mills-1959-aaian sociological imagination and @Keynes1936ian economic abstraction to bear on the nitty-gritty empirical data of and other welfare reform, to even discern the offense to the post-war social contract.

This blithe ignorance comes in at least four different flavors, that I here summarize as follows: -->

<!-- 1.  *TINA*-flavored literature holds that the mixed economy expired unavoidably and therefore, requires no further investigation.
    For TINAs, the mixed economy is not murdered, but dies a natural death.

2.  *Pangloss*-flavored literature accepts possible alternatives to death, but assumes that, axiomatically, it was the best possible course of action, and therefore acquits any possible suspect.
    For modern-day Panglosses, the defunct mixed economy is collateral damage to a worthy cause.

3.  *Newsspeak*-flavored literature shrouds itself in impermeable and misleading language.
    For newsspeakers, the mixed economy is not dying, but just "restructuring" into less complex organic compounds (known as "decay" in oldspeak).

4.  *Bystander*-flavored literature abstains from judgment, or even conclusion.
    For bystanders, it may or may not be murder, but it's none of their business. -->
    <!-- ### TINA

    > *"There \[...\] is no alternative."*\
    > --- Margaret Thatcher (London, 1980)

    TINA is hardly observed directly in the literature, if only because, as a political strategy, it aims to "veil the essentially political character of political decisions" [@Bluhdorn-2007-aa 314], and therefore, will not even explicate itself.
    The purported lack of alternatives, mostly, asserts itself not by negating existing alternatives, but by ignoring them. -->
    

Welfare regimes are, as [@Esping-Andersen-1990-aa] has said, systems of stratification in themselves, and they have been, from the very beginning socialist demands in the 19th century more than epiphenomenal income replacement.
They are tools to socialize the costs of painful, but welfare-enhancing @SchumpeterSwedberg-1942-aaian economic transformations as well as individual hardship and serve as engines to redistribute this very welfare as the legislator wishes.
The indeed quintessential and highly political question for globalization and welfare entrenchment is then, whether the state can *still* (or ever could) socialize and redistribute as it wants, with no limitations resulting from the behavior of other states.
Welfare state sustainability then has to be pitted not against past or current performance, but against a hypothetically desired welfare regime under global trade with global redistribution, both within and between countries.
In game theoretic terms, to gauge how badly welfare-depressing defection is, you first have to calculate the payoff for mutual cooperation.
In the global context, this certainly requires quite a bit of political imagination, something that political scientists, it appears, like to shy away from.
Even leaving normative considerations aside, in this case, academic rigor alone requires such exercise.

If welfare states can be well or poorly designed mixed economies, achieving different outcomes, we should also judge its prospects by comparing actual or evolving regimes to such hypothetical, but possible and desirable configurations.
That is a very different question than testing whether welfare states en- or retrench, let alone its spurious correlates of income replacement [@Swank-2005-aa] or even spending [@Kleinman2002 24], and a question that would deeply unsettle Pangloss.
As @Offe2003 reminds us:

> "The mode in which welfare state institutions change can be explicit reform and retrenchment.
> But it can also be inconspicuous and gradual decay.
> For instance, people may defect from public health and pension systems, trade unions see themselves forced into single-employer concessions bargaining, workers resort to unprotected forms of pseudo self-employment in order to avoid social security dues, if not to illegal ("black") forms of employment."\
> --- @Offe2003 [364]

@Genschel2005, too, reminds us of what Pangloss would rather have us forget:
"The effect \[of globalization\] is not so much to force change upon the tax \[and thereby, welfare\] state as to reduce its freedom to change.\" [-@Genschel2005 53].
This is why political scientists such as [@Pierson2002; @Pierson1996] that assume institutional constraints (for example, veto points, @Tsebelis-2002-aa) to only work to *prevent* retrenchment, are wrong:
the very same constraints that may prevent or delay nominal cuts will also make it harder for welfare states to *adapt* to, rather than just to recede in the face of changing economic and demographic circumstance.
Nondecision does *not* "generally favor the welfare state" [@Pierson1996 174].
While the welfare state might nominally have retrenched only "cautiously" [@Pierson1996 174], the ground underneath it has shifted, leading to a much graver de-facto change of positions:
it can no longer expand or react, relies on unsustainable deficits or real dissavings and must make do with growing inequality, and sometimes, structural unemployment, non of which @Pierson1996 even mentions.

To shake off Pangloss, and see clearly the demise of the welfare state, we must ask three new questions, that so far, much of the retrenchment literature has shirked:

1.  What, *given* a hypothetical, intact mixed economy, would welfare states be capable of, if their democratic sovereigns wanted it?
    This is a question that, absent natural experiments on the matter, cannot be subjected to straightforward positive test, because precisely such a hypothetical, intact mixed economy does not exist.
    Still, we must compare actual to hypothetical regimes, to find out just how constrained actual welfare states may, or may not be, by whichever second-order process we subsequently propose.

2.  What is the highest possible trade-off between equity and efficiency that an intact mixed economy can offer their democratic sovereigns?
    As I have argued in the above, better-designed mixed economies face less harsh --- or even no --- trade-offs between equity and efficiency than worse-designed mixed economies.
    The price for an additional increment of equity in efficiency (or vice versa) not only varies at the margin,
    [^17]
    but it also varies depending on the set-up of the mixed economy.
    For example, a highly progressive tax on consumption may allow same or greater equity at a much lower price than a compressed tax on labor income.
    [^18]
    More broadly, @Ganssmann2010 has proclaimed the Scandinavian welfare state as the "winner" to achieve higher levels of *both* equity and efficiency [-@Ganssmann2010 343].

    Amongst these higher trade-offs between equity and efficiency, there may, additionally, be local optima of equity-efficiency mixes, complemented by quite distinct institutional constraints and --- somewhat related --- path dependencies, ranging as wide as educational systems and industrial relations.

    I have here mostly ignored these *Varieties of Capitalism* [@HallSoskice-2001-aa]
    [^19]
    They, too, are important detail.
    They strongly suggest that there may not be *one* universal mixed economy design, but that quite different designs might coexist and specialize.
    Still, also within *each* of these varieties, there are again different trade-offs between equity and efficiency.
    Interestingly, the institutions that @HallSoskice-2001-aa identified as markers of [cmes]{acronym-label="cme" acronym-form="plural+short"} and [lmes]{acronym-label="lme" acronym-form="plural+short"} do *not* mention variants of tax, social insurance or any of the other key welfare state institutions.
    While [cmes]{acronym-label="cme" acronym-form="plural+short"} may correlate with, and are often conflated with Bismarckian welfare states, there is nothing about [cmes]{acronym-label="cme" acronym-form="plural+short"} that would make them necessarily rely on, for example, labor income-backed social insurance.
    Of course, the variant of capitalism will be reflected in the nitty-gritty of welfare state institutions:
    for example, the statuses originally maintained by Bismarck are, arguably, related to the categorical groups that [cme]{acronym-label="cme" acronym-form="singular+short"} educational systems create, or [cme]{acronym-label="cme" acronym-form="singular+short"} industrial relations are organized around.
    This institutional spill-over notwithstanding, I would hypothesize, that [cmes]{acronym-label="cme" acronym-form="plural+short"} and [lmes]{acronym-label="lme" acronym-form="plural+short"} might be able to achieve equally high trade-offs between equity and efficiency, even if the institutional implementation may vary:
    for example, [cmes]{acronym-label="cme" acronym-form="plural+short"} might continue to sport extensive job protection, while [lmes]{acronym-label="lme" acronym-form="plural+short"} will allow quick "hire and fire", potentially complemented by generous unemployment benefits (as in "flexicurity").
    Allocative results, either way, may be very similar, which is my point here.

    Even carefully crafted positive research into changing welfare states currently looks, at best, at cross-sectional or longitudinal variation in social transfers as a percentage of output [for example, @Ravenhill2005 249].
    This is much better scholarship than the naysayers who like to look only at absolute spending or income replacement, but still, it does not tell us how good a trade-off we are getting.

    To gauge the *level* of trade-off between equity and efficiency available to democratic sovereigns, the retrenchment debate has to look at allocative *results*, not at transfer flows, that is, at inequality (for example, Gini-coefficients) and growth (preferably measures more comprehensive than [gdp]{acronym-label="gdp" acronym-form="singular+short"}).

    Out of logical necessity, if nothing else, welfare state retrenchment, inequality and growth are *one question*.
    The compartmentalization of these into different academic areas allows not, as one would hope, greater theoretical clarity but instead confuses and waters-down concepts.
    If "welfare" is to mean anything, surely, it must be the ability of states to alter allocative *results*, and to do so at a minimum, or democratically acceptable price in efficiency.

    Consider the alternative research designs, that currently predominate.
    If income replacement stays the same [@Swank-2005-aa], but, realistically, incomes become more unequal and states more indebted, is that evidence of a non-retrenched welfare state?
    If transfer volumes rise absolutely, or stay constant relative to output [@Ravenhill2005], but, realistically, ever more people rely on ever smaller transfers, all paid for the labor-incomes of an already squeezed middle class, is that evidence of a non-retrenched welfare state?
    Surely, just external validity requires more extensive operationalizations.
    The best, theory-driven operationalization of a non-retrenched, welfare state is the intact mixed economy.

3.  How well does the welfare state work as an entire system of production and distribution, that is, as a mixed economy?
    This is a very different question from those based on a traditional, more limited definition of the welfare.

    @Offe2003, for instance, takes pains to remind readers that welfare states have nothing to do "with equality of outcomes', neither normatively nor positively", that "the guiding principle of principle (...) is the security and protection of workers, not equality" [-@Offe2003 450].
    This is a historically accurate definition, but it is no longer an externally valid conceptualization of welfare states, if the term is to be more than an empty hull devoid of positive reality and economic possibility.
    "Welfare states as worker protection" is not [mece]{acronym-label="mece" acronym-form="singular+short"} any more.
    By this definition, an economy, or rather, sectors thereof would be classified as a "welfare state", in which poorly qualified workers are nominally protected, but either structurally unemployed because their gross wages are higher than their productivity, or live in working poverty, ever unable to participate in the riches of the wider economy.
    To the people working in cleaning or security in Germany today, such a definition would not have a lot of face validity.
    The labor market for poorly qualified workers in Germany is then, at the same time, evidence of a welfare state and evidence of a non-welfare state.
    Conversely, by the traditional definition, an economy, or rather a sector thereof with no nominal protection, but generally high compensation and little economic hardship, would be classified as a non-welfare state.
    For example, freelancers in management consulting, earning handsome but unsteady labor (!) incomes, but equipped with enough assets to weather rainy days, surely do not enjoy welfare state protection.
    Still, at face validity, they also do not exactly suffer from Manchester style laissez-faire.
    Under the traditional definition, they reality is neither welfare-state, nor non-welfare state.

    @Offe2003 might, asked about the plight of German cleaners, point to a leak in the "Keynesian" roof of full employment, protecting the lower storeys of welfare states.
    Today, full employment is only a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for an intact roof.
    In fact, full employment might always have been merely necessary, and we were just lucky that in the past, all other necessary conditions were mostly met.
    To stay in @Offe2003's elegant metaphor, the welfare state house is facing much harsher weather.
    For example, severe crosswinds of rising income inequality (for example, winner-take-all, efficiency wages) diverging factor returns (for example, Stolper-Samuelson trade), threaten to further drive apart the different economic strata making up the house, threatening to tilt the building.
    In addition, international tax competition, but also home-made dysfunctions are eating away at some of the load-bearing walls, putting enormous stress on the few remaining walls and the (already struggling) people making it up.
    If all we care about in this house is whether the roof is still tight against cyclical unemployment, the structure will not stand much longer.
    If the house of the welfare state is to survive the throes of economic transformation, it needs strong cross-beams, to re-balance the load of its stories.
    These cross-beams are progressive redistribution, and we measure their solidity by looking at overall inequality.
    Today, if not always, the ability of a mixed economy to efficiently curb runaway inequality is the *sine qua non* of welfare states, too.

    This is not new to [@Offe2003], who also includes "monetary, fiscal, trade and economic policies" in the roof [-@Offe2003 543].
    However, he seems to neglect that consequently, the different stories of welfare protection *cannot* be organized (financed) irrespective of overall inequality:
    if, for example, the fiscal shingles are to remain intact, the protection schemes must charge those most who can best afford it and in a way that will least affect them.
    [^20]

    Surely, Pangloss would already despair over [@Offe2003]'s insistence on a full-employment protecting roof.
    But with inequality, we can and should ask him an even harder question that might reveal his unreasonable optimism in starker colors.

    In addition to these functional reasons, there are normative and empirical reasons to demand of welfare states worthy of the label to, at least, be able to curb inequality.
    Normatively, it seems questionable to constrain the surely emancipative agenda that once endowed welfare states to worker protection.
    That's quite little to ask of Pangloss.
    Empirically, we know that people care about *relative* differences in access to resources [@Frank2005], that they suffer from *relative* inequality [@Pickett-2009-kx].
    If we are welfare state researchers and, as humanists, care about the human outcomes of institutions, maybe more than evident at Bismarck's time, today inequality *is* that relevant outcome, even if and to the extent that absolute material security is achieved.
    
    To do meaningful second-order, sociological or political science work on the welfare state, you first have to do some first-order, economic work, if nothing else, because it lets us talk about welfare as if people mattered:

## Why it Matters: The Welfare State as Mixed Economy {#sec:why-mixed-economy-matters}


At this point, a reader may ask:
why would all, or even any of this, matter to the welfare state?

Materially possible and normatively desirable welfare states are, and must be thought of as, well-designed mixed economies, for at least three reasons:

1.  *Engaging Complexity.*
    In a welfare state, (p. ).
    For example, a (p. ) and the (p. ).

    To eradicate today, as Lord Beveridge promised 150 years ago, the five 'Giant Evils' of want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness, you have to anticipate this interplay of market and government and choose accordingly.
    The mixed economy provides us with a toolset to analyze the complexity of welfare states, including the dynamics presented here.
    For example, the mixed economy suggests we should always check the [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} (p. ) and (p. ) of any redistribution, a welfare state may undertake.

    To answer the first-order question of welfare state design, as I have here tried to do, we need the abstractions of the mixed economy to know what is *materially possible* in a scarce world, filled with (at least some) homines oeconomici.
    For example, price controls may not be possible (without grave losses), but a well-designed, personal, almost arbitrarily progressive taxation *is* indeed possible in a closed economy.

2.  *Denaturalizing Market Allocations.*
    When we consider welfare state programs in isolation from the markets which they supplant, we easily end up naturalizing whatever markets have allocated.
    In fact, any given market exchange which a welfare state may seek to correct, is already and always *contingent* on the institutions, dynamics and distributions under which it occured.

    For example, rather than "fighting poverty" --- as if that were an objective reality --- welfare states must consider overall allocative dynamics (such as , p. ) and distributions (such as , p. ), and counteract them, as is seen fair.
    Markets do not make some people below an arbitrarily defined threshold "poor", and leave others ok or even untouched.
    Instead, markets allocate incomes across the *entire* spectrum contingent on a host of institutions, dynamics and initial distributions.
    If government pursues a particular minimum standard of living for everyone, it might not only transfer income to those who fall below it, but may need to counteract those dynamics under which people slipped below the minimum standard in the first place.

    Market allocations, in short, are --- and should be --- no less subject to enlightened, collective human choice than remedial welfare state programs:
    "Increasing dependency is no law of nature but the result of socio-economic changes, which in turn react to human intervention" [@Esping-Andersen2002 x].

3.  *Caring about Outcomes.*
    @Haggard2009 ([-@Haggard2009 236]) remind us about

    > *"\[...\]
    > the importance of pushing the research on the \[Eastern European\] welfare state down the causal chain towards its social consequences.
    > \[...\]
    > \[A\]ny meaningful strategy of comparison of the welfare state must ultimately engage its consequences for a variety of outcomes, from poverty and inequality, to physical quality of life measures, to economic outcomes such as the efficiency of labour markets, competitiveness and even economic growth.
    > In the first instance, we are interested in the welfare state because we are interested in human welfare."*\
    > --- @Haggard2009 [236]

    The abstractions of the mixed economy I have summarized here synthesize a lot of what we need to know about the material, and therefore social consequences of a capitalist welfare state.

    When we care about social consequences, the mixed economy suggests a great deal more to consider than just nominal welfare programs.
    For example, welfare states should not only provide social insurance, but also redress failing (p. ) and (p. ).

    When we care about social consequences, the mixed economy also implies that not all welfare programs are created equal.
    For example, welfare states interventions should (p. ) and use (p. ).

    When we care about social consequences, the mixed economy suggests that governments and markets are better at different things, and it ties welfare state interventions to specific justifications.
    For example, welfare states should nationalize or regulate utility markets if and to the extent that they are (p. ), but there is no reason to (as Germany presently does) redistribute within (p. ), who was supposed to only save the risk pool from (p. ).
    Caring about social consequences also means to leave markets alone, if they will likely serve material human need best.

    When we care about social consequences, the mixed economy reveals that efficiency and equity are not always opposed, but often go hand in hand.

    1.  *Inefficient is Inequitable.*
        @Titmuss1974 urged welfare states not to exclusively concentrate on poverty relief because such "residual services (...) often become poor services for poor people" [-@Titmuss1974 134].
        This intuition is supported by the abstractions of the mixed economy:
        as the rich are forced or allowed to take the inefficient --- but for them, affordable --- exit route from government provision, a retrenched welfare state will offer only inferior provision, or none at all, to those too poor to exit.

        This problem is particularly acute in health or disability insurance:
        as the rich and healthy exit the risk pool, coverage becomes ever more expensive, driving even more people out until it (p. ).

        Similar distributive effects occur in a wider class of market failures, too.
        For example, a failed (p. ) of global climate or local public safety will not only be wastefully inefficient, but it will also hit hardest the poorest regions and people, who can least afford substitutes, such as building a levee or hiring private protection.

    2.  *Inequitable is Inefficient.*
        On the other hand, the abstractions of the mixed economy also imply that sometimes, slicing the pie unequally, will also make it smaller:
        "(...) there is a very good argument that equality of opportunities and life chances is becoming sine qua non for efficiency as well" [@Esping-Andersen2002 ix].

        For example, people may not be able to align the when collateral is not widely available (p. ), and overly taxing low and middle (labor) incomes may contribute to (p. ).

    To answer the first-order question of welfare state design, as I have here tried to do, we need the abstractions of the mixed economy to know what is *normatively desirable* in a scarce world, filled with (at least some) homines oeconomici.

#### Higher Equilibria.

The first-order conflict about the best, possible welfare state is about the trade-offs, contradictions and uncertainties of the mixed economy explained in the above.
My aim here was not to resolve that conflict:
we may not know for sure, let alone agree on what *the best* welfare state looks like (even though I offered some well-informed hunches).
A mixed economy can --- in principle and for my purposes here --- make *arbitrary* trade-offs between equity and efficiency, presence and future, or any of the other dimensions of human material need.

But given *any* preference set for these (sometimes!) competing goals, there are still more and less efficient institutional configurations for the mixed economy.
More efficient, in this broadest sense, means that these configurations achieve more on *all* goals.
These preferable mixed economies will still trade off preferred goals for less preferred goals, but the trade-off will be less harsh.
For example, a [nit]{acronym-label="nit" acronym-form="singular+short"} may achieve the same, if not more equity than a minimum wage, but at much lower cost in growth, or unemployment.
Of course, you still have to break eggs for the proverbial omelette, just fewer of them.

\centering
![A Production Possibilities Frontier of Equity and Efficiency in Different Tax Regimes[]{label="fig:ppf-tax-regimes"}](ppf-tax-regimes){#fig:ppf-tax-regimes width="1\linewidth"}

The competing goals of human material need, in other words, are not always in a pure and immutable zero-sum relation, where, for example, one increment more in equity means one less in efficiency, one more in present consumption one less in future consumption.
Depending on the institutional design, these conversion rates will differ:
sometimes, for example, one increment in equity will cost only a half-increment in efficiency.
Alternative mixed economies, more often than not, are a positive or --- equivalently --- negative sum proposition.

Just entering the preferences between purposely competing goals does *not* yield a single configured mixed economy, but many different blends of command and exchange production and distribution.
Again, we may not know or agree what the globally optimal configuration is, given our preferences, but checking and of a mixed economy, we *can* know better from worse configurations, or local optima.

A better welfare state is that mixed economy which elegantly combines and components to , , , and .
That is, a welfare state that offers one of the higher possible trade-offs of growth, individual security, equality, saving and convergence.
It does so without effectively borrowing from the future through , or hidden, but .

This view of the welfare state differs markedly from other perspectives:

Full Employment or Growth.

:   A popular variant on the purposive trade-off between equity and efficiency, is that between the policy goals of full employment or growth, sometimes supported by "demand-" or "supply-side" economics.
    @Offe2003 [-@Offe2003 453] finds a similar controversy about how to best keep up the full employment "roof" over the metaphorical Keynesian welfare state house, protecting the lower floors:
    market liberals (or supply-siders) want to deregulate so that *growth leads to more employment* and social democrats (and, sometimes, demand-siders) want to sustain welfare state protection so that *more employment stimulates growth*.

    These contenders both once had a (somewhat overstated) point, but as market failures grew and monetary policy improved, they are now both increasingly wrong.

    Market liberals are wrong because not all deregulation, or any amount of it, will stimulate growth, and conversely, not all redistribution or other intervention will depress growth.
    The abstractions of the mixed economy suggest that sometimes, command production is more (p. ).

    Social democrats, or more accurately, demand-siders are wrong because, of course, in the long run, *only* supply determines prosperity, and the depressed aggregate demand they *always* seem to suspect is clearly defined as a monetary phenomenon and unlikely to persist for very long.
    If it occurs, monetary expansion and fiscal stimulus should smooth it out, but that does not make for a roof.
    Social democrats are also wrong to believe that all redistribution and regulation is cost-free:
    there *are* [dwls]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="plural+short"}.

    The indicators of *activity* that both market liberals and social democrats usually obsess about --- [gdp]{acronym-label="gdp" acronym-form="singular+short"} and full employment respectively --- are both emphatically not related to greater (p. ).
    And so, they both sometimes fall for (p. ) and ignore (p. ).

    So how can we rescue full employment?
    By *not* fighting this last war, for at least two reasons.

    1.  Pushing macroeconomic policy to full employment risks overheating the economy and building up inflationary pressure.

    2.  More fundamentally, full employment no longer is (if it ever was) a necessary, let alone sufficient factor for anything we might consider socially desirable outcomes for a welfare state.
        Full employment in itself cannot, as the house metaphor suggests, provide any shelter for depleted , lemon-market , let alone address intertemporal failures or bubbles, to name just a few.
        More dearly to social democrats, full employment will also be increasingly unable to --- as the proponents of power resources had hoped --- level the playing field between capital and labor, simply because some of the major inequities no longer are between capital and labor, but also *within* labor incomes as (p. ).
        Even if the "reserve army of the unemployed" is fully activated, the resulting upward pressures on low (or all) wages will be no match for the governing dynamics of inequality enveloping the postindustrial economy (such as Baumol's cost disease).

    Full employment, and (properly defined) growth are still desirable --- because they are an efficient *outcome* --- but neither serves as a powerful *instrument* to reduce poverty or economic insecurity:
    "Promoting labour market participation is no substitute for income redistribution and the fight against poverty:
    more work does not necessarily mean less poverty" [@Esping-Andersen2002 ix].
    @Offe2003's metaphorical house of the Keynesian welfare state, in other words, does not need a few new shingles, but an altogether new roof.

    That new roof is the ability of the mixed economy to redistribute, efficiently and progressively as the democratic sovereign wishes.
    With that ability, welfare states can subsidize any (however small) minimal labor market income to any desired minimum standard of living (for example, through a [nit]{acronym-label="nit" acronym-form="singular+short"}), and can provide any level of social protection desired without counterproductively burdening low incomes (for example, by paying social insurance out of general tax revenue).
    Progressive redistribution could, if desired, dampen or counteract any existing income dynamic, including markets.
    @Offe2003 may be right that the welfare state did not "have much to do with 'equality of outcomes' ", but that does not make it tenable or desirable today [-@Offe2003 450].
    If you are serious about even just "security and protection of workers, not equality" (*ibid.*) you have to care about inequality and redistribution, at least a little.
    Without it, you will not have the resources to guarantee even such minimal, unequal outcomes for workers.
    I further develop this argument in my critique of the literature (p. ).

Decommodification

:   still serves well to distinguish different welfare states [@Esping-Andersen-1990-aa], but it, too, is no strategy for a possible and desirable mixed economy.
    Of course, welfare states may still "decommodify" (or *subsidize*) health care, education and replace (or *insure*) the incomes of the sick, disabled, old and unemployed, but such programs may be better described in the language of the mixed economy:
    as *specific* market interventions and redistribution.

    The difference is not merely semantic, but at least three substantial misunderstandings easily follow from this choice of terminology:

    1.  Decommodification suggests --- misleadingly --- that welfare states *could* take some aspects of life, and some people *off* the market.
        But, because command and exchange modes of production and distribution always interact, that cannot be done.

        For example, decommodification of disability income is easily misconstrued to mean that disability would no longer be affected by the market, and that markets would no longer be affected by disability.
        That is not so.
        When welfare states support the disabled, they not only exempt them --- as intended --- from earning a market income, but they may also make it cheaper, and therefore more likely for labor markets to *produce*, say, burn-out, depression or back pain.

        Thinking in the abstractions of the mixed economy helps us to avoid such pitfalls.
        In this case, we know that *insurance* of risks is prone to moral hazard, and that (Pigouvian) co-payments can save the commons of a prudent risk-pool.
        We can, if desired, slap a Pigouvian tax on risky or strenuous employment and activities, to make sure it is more costly, and is avoided.

    2.  Decommodification easily morphs from description to prescription, as for example, when income replacement becomes a measure for welfare state re- or entrenchment.
        Caring about outcomes, there is nothing inherently desirable or essential about decommodification, for four reasons:

        1.  To decommodify someone out of the market also means to exit someone out of the central institution, that aside from providing the substituted material sustenance, mediates much human cooperation, generates self-worth to many and allows people to shape the world around them, however marginally.
            Instead, we should "enable all citizens to participate in the mainstream of social and economic life" [@Esping-Andersen2002 ix].

        2.  Complete decommodification is a last resort response to hardship.
            Mixed economies have several alternative, and less intrusive, approaches to, for example long-term unemployment.
            Instead of generous, universal and unconditional --- and therefore decommodifying --- benefits, a mixed economy may subsidize low market wages with a continuous and regressive [nit]{acronym-label="nit" acronym-form="singular+short"}.

            The availability of a *specific* tool, may not much matter to the desirability of a welfare regimes:
            social outcomes do.

        3.  Decommodification, conceptually, if not always in reality, is ignorant of potential welfare losses, as some person is provided, or some activity done under command instead of exchange --- without a respective, justifying market dysfunction.
            Thinking instead, in the abstractions of the mixed economy, always ties a market intervention to a particular market failure or broader dysfunction, and considers the potential welfare losses.

    3.  Decommodification is both radical as a prescribed tool (exit the market) *and* strictly limited in its reach (only a set of included people or activities).
        To be sure, sometimes a complete move to (entitled) command provision and distribution may be necessary or desirable.
        Likewise, a democratic sovereign may choose to only care *a lot* about some market outcomes --- and decommodify them ---, and not care about others *at all*.
        But there is no reason that all welfare states should do so, let alone that we carve this specific vision of a social compact into our conceptual toolbox.

#### It follows:

for a better welfare state to strike any such optimal balance, even given arbitrary preferences, it needs an intact set of (p. ), (p. ) and (p. ) of a mixed economy.

Of these, tax is the elephant in the room:
it is by far the most versatile, precise and powerful tool of command production and distribution in the mixed economy.

None of this is a merely abstract or academic concern.
Much lies this balance of command and exchange:
everything we materially value, and with that, a great deal of the life chances of us all depends on an intact mixed economy.

This is also not a revolutionary project.
It does not ask for a new man, but it accepts, and timidly merely reforms *homo economicus*, the civilized version of our selfish demons.
It does not ask for a new institution, it carefully compromises existing ways of exchange and command.
The mixed economy, by any historical standard, is not a radical proposition.

This much, I hope, is widely agreeable.

Tax
---

Taxation in the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, for the most part, remains an exclusive competence for [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"}.
Under the acquis, only indirect taxes (VAT) are harmonized --- at ineffective, minimal levels --- with very limited cooperation in other fields (for example, @EuropeanCommission2009, @TaxCoordinationandTaxCompetitionintheEuropeanUnion-EvaluatingtheCodeofConductonBusinessTaxation2001).
Per its treaties, the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} can harmonise only *indirect*, always proportional taxes --- such as [vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- and only by *unanimous* decision of the Council on proposals by the Commission (Article 113, Treaty of Lisbon, 2009 / Article 93, Treaty Establishing the European Economic Community, 1957).
Union members do not even fully cooperate in collecting existing, national taxes:
instead of full reporting of all incomes, some incomes (for example, dividends) and some countries (for example, Luxembourg) are exempted and instead levy a proportional, much lower withholding tax.
It is, in short, no exaggeration to say that the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} has no fiscal institutions or even coordination to speak of.

In the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, there is no match between the scope of economic activity --- the union-wide common market --- and the scope of taxation.

With no union-level taxation, what does this mismatch do to
[ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"}-level taxes?
As the abstractions of the mixed economy suggest, tax competition results.
For example, [@Genschel2009] find that tax competition is different and greater within the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} than outside of it, and that it accelerates with time and enlargement.
[eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} tax competition is a [pd]{acronym-label="pd" acronym-form="singular+short"}, where states (strictly) dominantly prefer low taxes over high taxes and (Nash) equilibriate in suboptimal, mutual low taxation () on ).

If, and to the extent that such a race-to-the-bottom is at play in the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, it will affect both levels and schedules of national taxation.

#### Levels.

Straightforwardly, [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"} will be strictly limited in the overall level of taxation they can sustain.
Governments will no longer be free to set a level of taxation, or, equivalently, determine the command-exchange components of the mixed economy.
In some cases, tax levels may even fall, as has been shown for [cit]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="singular+short"} rates [@Piatkowski2008].

#### Base.

Moreover, and more importantly, competition will also alter the base composition of taxation.
To avoid large [dwls]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="plural+short"}, as they should, governments will turn to bases that are relatively price inelastic, that is, economic transactions that cannot be altered to escape taxation.
[eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} integration opens up a lot of new escape routes, especially for newly mobile capital, and, to a lesser extent, high-skilled labor:
they can relocate their economic activity to wherever the tax burden will be lowest.
This causes welfare-depressing distortions in the high-tax economy:
rather than face a now voluntary tax, these pareto-optimizing exchanges will not be made at all, and instead happen elsewhere.
For example, a rich entrepreneur otherwise willing to open a new factory in high income-tax Germany, may, faced with the new alternative of building the same facility in a low-tax location, forego his original plan.
Germany unambiguously looses welfare, both because the investment is not made, and also because it does not even generate any fiscal revenue.

Faced with these dynamics, governments will, again rightly so, shift their taxation to bases that are less prone to [dwls]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="plural+short"}, or equivalently, bases that are relatively less mobile.
Relatively less mobile bases in the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} will be consumption and labor incomes, because consumers and workers cannot easily do their shopping and working in another country.

Other --- partly dysfunctional --- taxes traditionally used to raise revenue for mixed economies will be rolled back or falter altogether.
This applies especially to --- anyway defunct --- national [cits]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="plural+short"} that large corporations can often evade easily, in part because nailing down the locale of any particular increment of income of a multinational firm will always be conceptually difficult.
For example, the German holding of Deutsche Bank AG can easily reassign a particular income stream to a Luxembourg-based subsidiary, arguing that a crucial business process occurred there.
Tax administrations will always, and necessarily, be unable to argue where any particular value was created (@Ganghof2006, @Ganghof, @Ganghof2007 [5]).
Similarly, higher brackets of progressive [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} will also cause large [dwls]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="plural+short"} or, more likely and wisely, disappear, as high-income individuals change residence or citizenship, offshore their income-generation to other countries, or at least shelter it in foreign corporations no longer affected by high, backstop [cits]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="plural+short"}.
For example, a rich German entrepreneur can establish a new holding in Ireland to buy up his German-based firm, and have it retain most if not all of the earnings, effectively escaping german income taxation.

If and to the extent that Pigouvian taxes, or even fees fall on mobile bases, these will also either cause excessive market distortions, or, more likely, disappear.
For example, a German steel producer may, (hypothetically!) faced with the German ecotax, relocate to Poland, avoiding the higher energy price, *without*, as the Pigouvian tax intended, raising the price of steel.
Overall energy intensity will remain the same, steel production will simply fall below equilibrium levels in Germany.

#### Schedule.

Crucially, by shifting the base, [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"} will also alter the schedule of their tax regimes.
By relying more on taxing labor incomes, schedules will become more regressive:
most large incomes in developed capitalist economies are not labor, but capital incomes.
By relying more on (pre-paid) consumption and other indirect taxes, schedules will become regressive or --- at best --- proportional:
even if rich people, just as others, eventually spend all their income, they will only pay the same percentage in [vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"} or similar taxes.
If union member governments wish to avoid, as they should, excessive [dwls]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="plural+short"} they will have to sacrifice progressivity in tax.
The already impaired, but lone vestige of progression, the [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} together with its ugly, but necessary backstop,
[^1]
the [cit]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="singular+short"} will either disappear altogether, or, largely equivalent, depress their schedules and degenerate into effective labor income taxes, with, at best, some residual but proportional taxation of capital.

Dysfunctions {#sec:defunct}
------------

What kind of an economic reality results from this open, but heterogeneous [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, with unbounded trade, mis-configured currency union and rampant tax competition?
It is, and must be, a deeply dysfunctional design, boxing the European household in unattractive policy dilemmas, wasting its communal resources, ever building new imbalances, harboring new crises, and, ultimately, fracture the social contract.

### Underfunding {#sec:public-squalor}

Straightforwardly, the strictly limited revenues of [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"} confine them to structural underfunding, or at least, constrain the command-exchange that mixed economies are otherwise free to make (p. ).
By subjecting taxes to competition, any increment in more command production and distribution must be bought at an increasing price in lost economic activity, or [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"}.

In this scenario, governments rebalance their Haig-Simons identities --- as they always must --- by cutting public consumption or dissaving out of their wealth.
This can take many, but entirely equivalent forms.
For example, governments can save on public goods, such as road maintenance, or it can reduce transfer payments, such as welfare benefits.
It can also dig into its savings, and take on new debt, or, let infrastructure fall into disrepair.

Here, too, government is faced with unattractive choices:
to either cut public spending to suboptimal levels, to go into debt or to otherwise dissave.

### Unemployment

The neoliberal agenda promised that if states cut their spending, at least their economies would greater economic growth.
Under a dysfunctional mixed economy, that is not necessarily so.
In the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, mixed economies cannot have the cake and eat it, they cannot even do one of the two.
Instead, its welfare states are faced with a twin crisis that is mutually reinforcing:
one of structural unemployment, and one of structural underfunding, as illustrated in (p. ).

Structural underfunding, aside from causing (p. ), in the long run may also diminish the kind of public and common goods that drive future economic growth, such as basic research or infrastructure, and especially, education.
Over the long haul, structurally underfunded states will ill-equip workers for a global marketplace, and leave them with comparatively poor labor productivities.

In addition, structurally underfunded governments are increasingly unable to transfer low- and middle-income workers, or, at least, exempt them from taxation.
In particular, the greater tax burden on immobile labor, and the constrained progressivity of tax under competition will make it even harder for workers to make ends meet at any given market income.
They have to pay more --- not less --- to the state, or, misleadingly named "social insurance" and keep even less for their personal consumption.

As a result, at least some workers will be relatively unproductive and face high taxes on their already low or middle market incomes.
If and to the extent that [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} welfare states maintain some minimum socially acceptable living standard, either through a minimum wage, or, equivalently, welfare transfers, these low and some middle income earners will find it increasingly difficult to earn enough on the market to meet this standard.
Any --- already diminished --- income will be further depressed by a tax wedge driven between the gross and net disposable incomes.
Both in a minimum wage, and a welfare transfer regime, those workers with productivities too low to make the minimum income on the market will exit the market, and collect welfare instead --- not out of laziness, but out of necessity.

The ensuing structural unemployment, in turn, reinforces the structural underfunding of the mixed economy government.
First, it creates greater needs for transfers, putting further strain on public transfers.
Secondly, it also depresses growth, and in the long run, diverges the economy from its long-term growth path, as segments of the labor force lie needlessly idle.

Alternatively, of course, governments can lower effective price floors by cutting welfare benefits, minimum wages or by raising work requirements.
By lowering minimally acceptable social standards --- frequently euphemised as "structural realignments" or "labor market flexibility" --- states will have to abandon central welfare tenets and create and accept, once again, widespread working poverty.
That is, [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} welfare states can brake the vicious cycle of underfunding and unemployment if they cease to be welfare states, a configuration that [@StreeckMertens2010] have aptly called a "permanent austerity regime".

Governments of dysfunctional mixed economies, here, as always, are faced only with equally unattractive options:
to either save social standards at the price of structural unemployment and depressed growth, or to abandon them and risk widespread working poverty.

This dual crises, and the uneasy choices it forces, will only be exacerbated in a modern and open economy.
Modern economies already produce highly unequal returns, as winners take all and, equivalently, Baumols cost disease looms.
A modern economy will, by its very structure tend to produce people whose productivities are much lower than the overall productivity of their host countries.
Trade, migration and capital mobility add even more pressure.
As countries specialize even more according to their factor endowments (think: Romanian Nokia, German Management Consulting), remaining, relatively scarce factors (think: unskilled laborer in Germany) may find their market wages fall even further below the respective socially acceptable minimum income.
Especially rich states may then be forced to redistribute income to these individuals, but find themselves unable to raise the necessary revenues (progressively) without further reducing their competitiveness.

### Inequality

Lacking any union-level fiscal institutions and marred by tax competition between the [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"}, the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} mixed economy lacks effective tools to redistribute market outcomes.
Both *within* and/or *between* member states, rampant inequality will remain unchecked, or even further widen.

At home, the mixed economy has lost its ability to dampen (possibly accelerating) winner-take-all dynamics, and to compensate the losers from trade and economic transformation.
[^2]
The great U-turn back towards more inequality, in Europe as elsewhere in the [oecd]{acronym-label="oecd" acronym-form="singular+short"} is well under way [@AldersonNielsen-2002-aa].
As tax competition both erodes the base and depresses the progressivity of taxation, market allocations, increasingly, are final.
Moreover, structural underfunding and associated public squalor will also hit hardest the lower and middle income earners, further widening the divide in living standards.
Rich people can afford to exit from public provision, for example by paying doctors out of pocket, by sending their children to private schools or even walling their gardens and gating their communities.
Lower and middle income earners have no such exit option, but are stuck with decrepit public provision.

Between [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"}, too, inequality will remain unchecked, as member and union level governments have no instruments to alter distributive dynamics of trade, that may --- or may not --- lead to fast convergence of productivities, and related, living standards.
What is worse, the poorer mixed economies are especially constrained:
at low productivities, they can least afford to burden mobile capital, and other mobile, high-earning factors, such as professionals with any, let alone progressive taxation.
With open borders, but without coordinated tax or union-level transfers, these poorer [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"} currently can only take the hard, unmitigated route to economic convergence:
they tax mostly (low-productivity) labor, proportionally if not regressively, and at low overall public spending levels [for example, @DaudUngl2008 267].
By contrast, in the higher-productivity, rich [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"}, corporatist arrangements, strong trade unions and substantial, if increasingly dysfunctional welfare regimes can still eek out pockets with sometimes generous welfare provision:
in always capital-intensive, often high-value add and sometimes oligopolistic --- not commodity ---production, these economies can, at least in some sectors, afford welfare.
For example, a Bavarian specialist engine builder with high capital and relatively low labor inputs and maybe a handful competitors on the world market, may, faced with strong unions, accept above-equilibrium, possibly efficiency wages.
Not so in Romanian manufacturing:
Producing low-margin commodities, with little capital but hundreds of competitors and easy access, firms have to compete tooth-and-nail on labor costs.
And so, [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"} may not only fail to converge as quickly, or as closely as they could, or hoped to, but the very *conditions* for economic development will diverge widely.
The rich, high-productivity [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"} can still, if inefficiently and incompletely, dampen and distribute the pain of whichever economic shock hits or transformation sets in.
In the poor, low-productivity East and South, it will be bare-bones laisséz-faire capitalisms.
[^3]

In the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, Kuznet's and Keynes' grand hopes, that welfare would --- and should --- always follow growth, are dashed (as cited in [@Galbraith2002a 22].
If they have any choice at all, it is a very unattractive one for the governments of the union:
they can either stay in the common market and reap the gains from trade and abandon all or some welfare, *or* they can exit the union, stall economic integration, save their welfare regimes and retreat to autarky and recession.

Democratic governments, firms and households alike will be under great strain from the underfunding, unemployment and inequality that a dysfunctional mixed economy creates.
They may take on any possibility to temporarily relief the pressure they are under, even if it will not solve, or even exacerbate the situation in the long run:
here, too, humans and the institutions they man, suffer from time inconsistency.

In modern financial capitalism and complex societies, there are some powerful painkillers to numb the effects of a dysfunctional mixed economies.
As painkillers go, they treat the symptoms, not the disease, and have serious side effects.
And so it is with the macroeconomic temptations in the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}:
as powerful drugs, they seemingly let economies transcend their material means, spread euphoria and frenzy.
Only their cure is, ultimately, delusional, their treatment addictive.
While under the charm of such chimerical boom and prosperity, economies keep building pressures and imbalances, that, one day, will unload in financial shocks and systemic crises, that, if sufficiently large, can disturb or bring down entire markets.
After this kind of ecstasy always comes a day of reckoning, with a catastrophic hangover.

Just when an economy is in such drug-enduced delusion, and living beyond its long-term growth path is, as always in uncertain markets, hard to tell.
National balance of payments accounts provide as in (p. ) an intuitive, if rough-and-dirty first indication.
Between economies, too, an identity akin to Haig-Simons and the conservation of matter, holds:
for any good or service that leaves the country, there must ultimately be imports of equal value, or, a change in ownership of foreign assets, that is, the promise of *future* imports of goods and services.
Conversely, any import must be matched by exports of equal value or it will be offset in *foreign* ownership of domestic assets, that is, claims against future domestic production.
As all the most important economic abstractions, this one is simple:
balance of payments accounts are double-entry bookkeeping, only at the economy level.

The components of balance of payments accounts, as the Haig-Simons identity, break down over households, firms and governments.
For example, in a fictions German account, households can import olive, or firms can import particle filters as semi-manufactured inputs, or governments can import commuter trains for public transportation (, p. ).
In these accounts too, positions of one owner are offset by positions of other owners in the same economy.
For example, German household exports of home-made cuckoo clocks can be offset by said firm imports of particle filters in a roundabout way, when clockmakers buy French-particle-equipped German cars, or following some other chain of exchanges.
Positions also offset across the equality sign.
For example, German household imports of olive oil may be offset by government issues of German bonds to Greek oil producers, with the government channeling the revenue to oil-consuming welfare recipients, or through a myriad of other transfers.

![A (German) Balance of Payment Account with Examples[]{label="fig:bop"}](balance-of-payments){#fig:bop width="100%"}

Balance of Payment accounts are easily misunderstood or oversold, for a four reasons:

1.  Trade deficits and surpluses between any pair of countries are frequently reported, but meaningless and entirely unproblematic, just as shoppers need not worry about a trade deficit with the local supermarket.
    Trade deficits --- as consumer debt --- are potentially worrying only if they are *net* of all exchanges with all trading partners.

2.  Conversely, balance of payments accounts do not apply only between countries, as is easily assumed, but is, in fact a meaningful and true identity between any group of market participants and the rest of their trading partners, all the way down from nations to households.
    For example, a trade deficit may also arise between laggard regions, impoverished demographics or even generations, and the rest of an economy, with much the same possible problems.

3.  In the short term, even such trade deficits may not be problematic, but, in fact, help to stabilize economies from exogenous shocks.

4.  Even in the medium and long run, persistent trade deficits may be ok if and to the extent that the resultant capital inflows can reasonably be expected to currently, or in the future, earn whichever factor income was promised.
    For example, emerging economies may well experience persistent trade deficits for some time, while machinery is imported to equip the workforce, if and to the extent that the resulting, now capital-deepened production pays off as expected.

Still, balance of payments accounts are an immensely enlightening abstraction, without which trading mixed economies cannot be well understood:

1.  Trade deficits are not a sufficient, but still a necessary condition for building macroeconomic imbalances.
    Not every trade deficit will betray an economy living beyond its means, but every economy artificially held above its long-term growth path by said financial drugs *will* leave a grave trade deficit in its wake.

2.  The balance of payments identity shows, as Keynes argued forcefully, if somewhat ineffectively at the Bretton-Woods conference in 1944, that these macroeconomic imbalances know no *one* culprit.
    The loaded language notwithstanding, both deficit *and* surplus economies are, equally, at fault.
    One parties excessive imports are another parties dumping exports.
    To get to equilibrium, where imports equal exports, either of the two parties, or both, must change its prices.
    To pride oneself, as German leaders frequently do, in being an export champion --- but not an import champion --- is but a mindless return to the folly of beggar-thy-neighbor, and, before that, mercantilism.

3.  Financial flows always track flows of tangible goods and services, as well as vice versa.

4.  It does not much matter *who* --- households, firms or government --- in an economy creates the trade deficit.
    Only the deficit net of all economic actors in a given region matters.

How, then, do we know the acceptable trade deficits, from the unsustainable ones?
We look at the offsetting changes in the capital account, and check whether these are intertemporally efficient, or whether they were enabled by failed markets.
In the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, as in any other mixed economy, we must beware of these smoke and mirrors, that only forestall and worsen the inevitable day of reckoning:
credit bubbles, asset bubbles, inflationary pressure, and nominally invisible, but real dissavings.

Credit Bubbles & Default.

:   Trade deficits can precipitate in capital inflow, as new foreign-held debt.
    To receive their extra imports, deficit economies issue different forms of IOUs, including government bonds, corporate debt and household credit, sometimes backed by physical collateral, as in a mortgage.

    If the sum of these debts, is sound, so is the trade deficit.
    If debts, sour, or were overly optimist to begin with, the trade deficits cannot stand.
    Consider the two scenarios:

    1.  The loans are performing as long as, if, and to the extent that whichever projects they financed generate sufficient earnings to pay back interest and principal.
        For example, if the extra, imported surplus production the IOUs enabled were transformed into a competitive factory that now churns out export merchandise, the loan can be paid be back out of these exports and revenues.

        In the [bop]{acronym-label="bop" acronym-form="singular+short"}, the initial trade deficit is first offset by the loaned capital inflow, which later flows out again as the loan amortizes, offset by foreign factor payments and exports of the produced merchandise.
        In effect, the loan has, as efficient credit should, inter-temporally balanced past trade deficits with future trade surpluses and/or foreign payments.
        It matters little whether, and in which proportion the amortization on the capital account is offset by either foreign payments or equivalent actual exports, and whether the factory's merchandise is actually for export or domestic consumption.
        In the balance of all economic transformations and exchanges, successful factories and other projects can always honor their loans *without* curtailing the living standard of the population.
        Interest, and maybe even collateral, are paid back out of *extra* production that would not have otherwise occurred.
        We need not worry about this kind of trade deficit:
        because it moves everyone closer to the long-term growth path, is an inter-temporal Pareto, or at least Kaldor-Hicks optimization.

    2.  The loan goes bad as soon as, if, and to the extent that whichever projects they financed do not generate sufficient earnings to pay back interest and principal.
        For example, if the factory is not competitive, or --- more to the european point --- no one needs or can afford the airports, malls and mansions into which the extra imports were coagulated, there are no revenues or exports to pay back the loan.
        In the extreme, but conceptually similar and now plausible case, the extra imports were not meaningfully coagulated into capital at all, but were simply consumed away at present.

        Come the day of inevitable reckoning, the deficit economies have two choices:

        1.  If the loan in question carries effective recourse, the deficit economy has to return the loaned capital in other, *material* ways.
            As when a leasing company repossesses a car on which payment the lessee has fallen behind, deficit countries must return the surplus production in some form.
            For example, the deficit economy may ship back the foreign-financed machinery in the project, or, more likely, return the same amount of surplus production transformed into some other good or service.

            This is the hard way of rebalancing the [bop]{acronym-label="bop" acronym-form="singular+short"}:
            the inevitable, promised outflow of capital on the capital account (reflecting net changes in the ownership of, but not generation of, assets) can be balanced only with an often painful trade *surplus*, because there are no factor incomes to be otherwise offset on the current account, reflecting a nation's income.
            Either way, a failed investment enforces a later, and often painful trade surplus to return principal and return.

        2.  Alternatively, if and to the extent that debtor economies (can) forego recourse and exert sovereignty vis-a-vis creditor economies, they (partially) default on their commitments and simply refuse to return the coagulated surplus production.
            In that case, creditors are stuck with their claim.
            By fiat, the original loans become full, or partial *transfers* from the debtor to the creditor economies.
            Here as always, the two sides of the [bop]{acronym-label="bop" acronym-form="singular+short"} identity cancel out:
            the original trade deficit is matched by a later, ex-post, enforced, foreign payment in the form of debt forgiveness, haircut or default.

        No matter the choice, this kind of trade deficit is never an optimization, but an unavoidable *redistribution*, either from surplus future to deficit present if and to the extent that debtors pay, or from creditors to debtors, if and to the extent that debtors default.

        Crucially, it matters very little who in the deficit economy --- households, firms or government --- initially took on debt.
        These non-performing loans will redistribute from future to present, or creditor to debtor no matter who signed them.
        In many cases, government will be forced to act as the lender of last resort and take on, or guarantee all the bad loans, both to counteract adverse selection and, often to save an exposed banking system from systemic crash.
        Even if and to the extent that government, or, equivalently, future taxpayers, can avoid to take on the bad loans, the redistribution is merely concentrated on whoever remains nominal debtor.
        Domestic policy can force only *some* people --- ideally those responsible --- to repay, but, short of default --- another redistribution --- it cannot void the need to repay.
        Here, as always, something akin to economic conservation of matter reigns:
        when credit bubbles burst, someone will have to pay back the future, either some debtors, all taxpayers, some creditors, or any combination thereof.

        In addition to these mere inter-temporal distributions, credit bubbles and associated mass defaults or austerity, of course, also waste economic welfare, because of the turmoil they harbor, not to mention the hardship they imply.
        As the business cycle fluctuates wildly in such crises, the economy diverts from the long-term growth path, leaving resources either depressively idle, or manically scarce.

        Credit bubbles are a market failure that may plague any economy --- not just the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} --- but the european, defunct mixed economy is particular prone to them, for at least three reasons:

        1.  The [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, until at least 2012, exercised most macroprudential oversight and otherwise mostly regulated financial markets at the [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"} level.
            Here, even the regulatory arm of the mixed economy was impaired, and regulations might have been arbitraged to suboptimal levels.

        2.  Monetary policy drives bank lending.
            The [ecb]{acronym-label="ecb" acronym-form="singular+short"}, because it can set only *one* monetary policy, was unable to react to credit bubbles in individual markets or regions, such as Spain or Greece.

        3.  Equivalently, if there were in the [emu]{acronym-label="emu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, or ever hoped to meet the its nominal convergence criteria, deficit and credit-crazed [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"} also could not devalue their currency through monetary interventions.

Asset Bubbles & Crashes.

:   Broadly similar, and often concomitant to credit bubbles, asset bubbles can also fuel trade deficits.
    As some assets in the deficit economy are persistently overvalued, foreign investors buy up these domestic assets, offsetting the trade deficit on the current account with a capital inflow on the capital account.
    Real estate, stock or some other asset that did not previously exist, or belonged to domestic investors, changes hand to foreign investors, expecting an ex-post unreasonable return.
    Come the day of reckoning, asset prices plunge, and much the same process sets in as when credit bubbles burst, only in asset bubbles, the default incidence is on the foreign investor, because she will usually, if not always, have taken risk-bearing equity in the asset.

    Asset bubbles, too, are a redistribution from a future day of reckoning to a manic present, and, in that future, a redistribution from foreign investors to the domestic economy.
    In addition, asset bubbles also waste welfare:
    when they burst, they spiral downwards, often cause grave systemic risk and generally divert the economy from the long-term growth path.

    Asset bubbles, too, are a universally looming market failure, but the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} is particularly vulnerable, again, because of likely regulatory arbitrage and ill-fitting monetary responses to local business cycles.

Monetary Expansion & Inflation

:   Overly expansive monetary policy can also enable unsustainable trade deficits.
    In this scenario, central banks simply inject more fiat money into the economy to offset the current account deficit with a Potemkin inflow of capital.
    Fiat money, of course, never creates capital, and if, when and to the extent that this bluff is called, inflation ensues:
    money supply and demand equilibrate at new, higher price levels.

    This problem is widespread in the [emu]{acronym-label="emu" acronym-form="singular+short"} with asynchronous business cycles, a single interest rate target and no transferred stimulus to speak of.
    In those regions where a low interest rate pumped too much money into the economy, as now appears to have been the case in Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece preceding the 2008ff crisis, loose money silently credit and asset bubbles, and might have already built yet-to appear inflationary expectations.

    Inflation, here, as always, wastes resources and redistributes arbitrarily.
    The middle class and older people, with frequently nominal denominated assets (pensions), but real denominated liabilities (rents) will be particularly vulnerable to whichever level of inflation this crisis might, eventually, bring.

    Inflation, too, as the other temporary diversions from the long-term growth path, redistributes from the future to the present.
    Even inflation does not spiral to double-digits or more, *any* additional increment in medium-term inflation and expectations is costly, as disinflating to previous levels is painful and often causes prolonged unemployment.

Dissaving & Depletion

:   Trivially, economies can also go into unsustainable trade deficits by real dissaving.
    Instead of, say, selling shares in domestic companies, the deficit economy can just burn more of strictly limited fossil carbon, diminishing its real, if not its nominal assets.

    Because such real assets, including an economies infrastructure, demography, environment or CO2e levels as unresolved commons have no defined ownership rights, they do not nominally show up in the capital account of an economy.
    Whatever this assets are transformed into, however, may well show up as an export in the current account.
    For example, a deficit economy can dig into its coal and iron ore resources, transform them, and export them as steel, offsetting other imports.
    Because the dissaving in natural resources is not usually recored, and thus triggers no change in the capital account, the steel export revenue will erroneously be attributed as a domestic *income* in full, when in truth, much of the revenue comes from dissaved domestic assets, that ought to be recorded on the capital account.

    Such dissavings --- by definition --- redistribute from the future to the present.
    As dissaving most easily and nominally invisible occurs out of vulnerable commons, it also wastes the welfare of some of our most precious, communal resources.
    If, when and to the extent that they are depleted to sustain trade deficits, we may never or only at great cost be able to restore them.

I cannot marshall evidence here to show how each of these dynamics caused the 2008ff Euro, let alone the broader sovereign debt crisis.
Nor can anyone, in 2012, reliably predict which of imbalances may yet turn out to be unsustainable, and why.
What I do claim here is that whatever the actual imbalances and crises of the embattled [emu]{acronym-label="emu" acronym-form="singular+short"} and [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} are, or will be, they will, underneath it all, follow these scripts.
Using some economic imagination, *these* are imbalances and resulting periodic crises we would expect to plague any such internally open, but dysfunctional mixed economy.

While this european mixed economy may be of its own kind, the market failures that enable these imbalances and trigger the resulting crises are in no way *sui generis*.
The herding and information externalities that inflate asset and credit bubbles, the systemic chain-reactions that loom on large defaults and the tragic commons depleted by real dissavings are the kind of market failures that plague all real-existing capitalism.
As such, they must be meet the appropriate regulatory, fiscal, and --- to a lesser extent --- monetary responses.
Similarly, loose money tempts governments of all market economies, not just --- in fact, probably, least of all --- in the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}.
It, too, must everywhere be curtailed by policy:
a constitutionally-enshrined monetary governance, preferably a robustly independent central bank, bound to a well-defined goal.
Because as dangerous drugs endemic to capitalism, these problems are not European problems, they also do not require a European solution.

Still, the deficient european acquis exacerbates the imbalances and crises looming everywhere, in at least three ways ([echoed by @Bordo2011 25]):

1.  Without a monetary union or nominal convergence criteria thereto, trading economies can intervene in their exchange rate, or, at least, let their currencies depreciate freely.
    As adjustment mechanisms, none is as fast as currency devaluation to get out of trade deficits.
    In an instant, imports become more expensive and exports become cheaper, ideally, until import and exports equilibrate at the free exchange rate.
    Alternative --- and ultimately equivalent --- domestic readjustment of (higher) prices and (lower) wages often takes longer, maybe too long to avert a [bop]{acronym-label="bop" acronym-form="singular+short"} crisis.

    Discretionary exchange rate interventions are difficult to get right, and easily deteriorate into competitive devaluation, or beggar-thy-neighbor by a fancy name.
    Freely fluctuating exchange rates, in turn, are costly as the second theory of optimal currency areas reminds us,
    and they, too, might be the result of herding or otherwise failing global currency markets.

    As drug addiction therapies goes, the methadone of devaluation is, at best, a mixed blessing.

    And still, it is a prescription, the european economy has to do without, no matter the indication.
    Within the [emu]{acronym-label="emu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, everyone in the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} who ever wants to join, currencies cannot fluctuate.
    To readjust, member economies can only hope their wages will not be too downwardly sticky.

2.  Creditors and debtors alike will anticipate the systemic risk and spillovers that the monetary union bestows on all its members.
    They know that other members too, would suffer from defaults or, related, [emu]{acronym-label="emu" acronym-form="singular+short"}-exit, and, therefore, will likely bail them out.
    With systemic default risk as a union-level commons, but decisions in individuals, firms and, at best, [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"}-hands, credit everywhere, but particularly in the high-risk economies, will be too loose.

    The [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, in other, metaphorical words, is not only plagued by powerful and addictive drugs, but dealers and addicts alike can reasonably expect to be saved --- as the should --- if they overdose.

3.  Lastly, and familiarly, the european mixed economy lacks the fiscal means to otherwise rebalance internal demand, that intact mixed economies use to mitigate regional imbalances, including public works, industrial policy, or even straightforward transfers.

The imbalances that have built up over the last years of European integration, and the crises in which they now seem to erupt, tell of the market failures of our capitalist economy.
But they also betray the underlying dysfunctions and unfairness of an impotent mixed economy, that built these pressures in the first place.
To bemoan only the market failure, and to seek to redress it is as naive as it is dishonest.
Even worse, to simply wish away the crises, and to blame someone ("the banks") --- *anyone* ("'the markets") for our misfortune, is to shoot the messenger, rather then to heed her warning.

In drug policy, if you are faced with a rampant substance abuse, you have to follow [@Mills-1959-aa], and sociologically re-imagine the saddening observation of an overdosed corpse:
you have to ask how, and why, people socially turn to harmful drugs in the first place, and then, if you can, cure this anomie, whatever it may be.
If you only wage a war on drugs, they will always win.

And so it is with the imbalances and crises facing the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} today:
we have to use our economic imagination to explain how, and why, the european economies turned to delusional market failures in the first place, and, if we can, strengthen them to resist any siren call.

Our anomie, now, should be clear enough:
it is the underfunding, unemployment and inequality left untouched by an impaired command arm, that slowly, but steadily, unravels the social contract of the mixed economy.
Faced with such pressures, it is little wonder that individuals, firms, states and the household-writ-large they collectively make up turn to the sirens of delusional growth.

Boxed in, as it is, the dysfunctional mixed economy, and especially its poorer constituents, find ways to relieve such economic pressure *somewhere*, to postpone such austerity to *somewhen* and disguise such anomie *somehow*.

To now, as many do, deplore only the failing markets,
[^4]
to demonize investors or politicians is an act of exorcism.
It was *we*, who made a Faustian bargain with these devils:
to let them reign free, if only they could numb the economic pain.
They obliged us.
But no one, as Doctor Faustus, should be surprised if some day, there is hell to be paid.

An Old Deal

To insist on an intact mixed economy is not so innovative.
The mixed economy is, in fact, a very old deal, prepared by the social reforms of Chancellor Bismarck, forged by Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, institutionalized by Lord Beveridge and, with miraculous success, reactivated in war-torn Germany, by Chancellors Adenauer and Erhardt.
If there is such a thing as a European social model, or really, *any* capitalist social model, it is the mixed economy.

To insist on an intact mixed economy is also not radical.
The mixed economy, is, at heart, a compromise of exchange and command, of market and state, of individual freedoms and duties, of efficiency and equity.
The mixed economy hopes not for an end of history, nor harbors any overhaul of society:
it makes amends with capitalism.

Tax --- the cornerstone of the mixed economy --- in particular, is a reformist, never a revolutionary project.
Good taxation, especially of consumption, accepts private property as given, even legitimate and desirable, and merely adjusts the sticks and carrots that people reap for their personal enjoyment.
Minimizing their [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"}, good taxation maximizes the freedom of all market participants to do as they would *absent* the tax.

Today, Europe is reneging on this old deal.
Without union-level taxation to speak of but with full factor and goods mobility, tax schedules are compressed and levels lowered.
Without fiscal complements, the common currency allows imbalances and lets diverging business cycle fluctuate widely.
Even regulation is yet incomplete, such as in labor market legislation, and is arbitraged away by competition.

On these institutions rides it all:
that we can efficiently produce public good cancer research or preserve our environmental commons, that we can pool the risks of the healthy and the frail, that we can restore some fairness between market winners and losers, that our children will receive at least what we have received, and that our neighbors prosper, too.
Tax especially, and together with regulatory and monetary institutions, *are* the social contract of modern capitalism.

European regional integration does not rewrite the social contract, but sins by blithely omitting much of passages on tax, monetary and regulatory policy.
Absent them, the european polity is no longer free to choose between
command and exchange, but --- without explicit popular consent --- defaults to ever more market, and ever more present consumption.
Our household-writ-large now occupies a greatly constrained coordinate space (), boxed in by chronic underfunding, looming unemployment and rampant inequality, shaken by recurring imbalances and crises.

![Constrained Coordinate Space of a Dysfunctional Mixed Economy[]{label="fig:coordinate-space-constrained"}](coordinate-space-constrained){#fig:coordinate-space-constrained width="100%"}

By its dysfunctional design, the european mixed economy yields ever more to markets while the other part of the mixed economy, the state, is on the retreat.
Bereft of their old, flexible and capable social contracts, the acquis will, nay, already *has* --- however fortuitously --- remade european society in the neoliberal, consumerist image.
"Neoliberalism" and "consumerism" are, in this case, not catch-all labels of disaffection, but I choose them with equal anger and care, and they apply precisely.
The aquis is:

Neoliberal,

:   because, eviscerating the state, it morphs markets from one of several *means*, to inescapable *reality* or even ultimate *end*, neither of which it is, nor should be.

:   because, it cannot set a positive savings rate, and leaves austere members no choice but to loot real savings, and give into the temptations of bubbles.
    As a result, much of the resources of the communal household will be devoted to near-term consumption.

Just how angelic the postwar mixed economy really was, I do not know.
[^6]
Still, *relative* to 19th century mass poverty [@MarxEngels-1848-aa], 20th century "mob politics" [@Crouch2004 158] and the spectre of 21st century neo-laissez-faire, the mixed economy, and the welfare state it has enabled, appears as singular achievements of the modern era.
The economic institutions of Postwar Western Europe have brought about unseen prosperity and equity, all in relative peace and freedom.

That is an old deal worth fighting for.



## Why Tax Matters to Democracy

> *"But who can say how much is endurable, or in what direction men will seek at last to escape from their misfortunes."*\

## The Social Contract

Crucially, we must, again, understand that economic integration must always beget more economic and political integration, that, production at great economic scale implies solidarity at the same scale.

*That* is the story of economic integration and material progress.
Living on a scarce and harsh planet, for which, alone, we are ill-equipped, we escaped the @Malthus1798ian curse of overpopulation and starvation by scaling up our production.
That is, to this day, how we remake an arithmetically growing material world, to feed our geometrically growing hunger:
we join forces to bend upward the production curve, and wrest from it above-linear returns.
To reap such economies of scale, in agriculture [@Diamond1997], in the production of violence [@Tilly-1985-aa], or in europe-wide automotive engineering [@Krugman-1980-aa], we have to master the feat of cooperation in the face of atomistic incentives.
Akin to ever-increasing entropy, the arrow of pre-historic organic life, and history of human life on earth progresses by increasing complexity, specialization, but also, always, mutual dependence.
@Wright1994 thus describes the transformation of individual cells into higher organisms:
they become richer, more resilient, but they must also sacrifice, and will do so only to the extent that they have successfully merged their genetic instructions [-@Wright1994 Chapters 7, 8].

And so it is with european, or other regional economic integration:
opening up commerce to one common market makes everyone richer by the magic of comparative advantage --- if not necessarily by the same amount.
But, if this association is to remain stable, some other elements of human organization have to follow to that higher level, if they are not to perish and destabilize.
In the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, continent-wide commerce also requires continent-wide taxation, regulation and monetary policy, if the formerly stable and re-productive system of a mixed economy is to remain operative.

The genius of the otherwise hyper-federal, and hyper-liberal US Constitution is that it foresees this functional necessity in its commerce clause.
[^11]
It stipulates that, precisely as commerce traverses the otherwise autonomous states, the federal polity asserts itself.
The German constitution knows a similar norm:

> *"The Federation shall have the right to legislate on matters \[...\] if and to the extent that the establishment of equivalent living conditions throughout the federal territory or the maintenance of legal or economic unity renders federal regulation necessary in the national interest."*\
> --- Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany: Article 72, Paragraph 2 (Bonn, 1949)
> [^12]

It too, displays the same genial insight into the relationship between economic and political integration:
as the commerce clause, it does not compel any particular social or other policy, but, if economic integration has occurred, endows the democratic sovereign to rule at the newly emerged, higher level of societal organization.


Optimists, not just of the Panglossian kind, are always inclined to see glasses half-full, and so many argue that any, even imperfect or negative European integration is better than none.
That is not so much optimistic, as it is hopelessly naive.
The metaphor is flawed.
Societies are not just glasses half-full or half-empty, they are dynamic systems, residing within, and reproducing the walls of this glass:
half-*built* glasses, as the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} defunct mixed economies, are not merely waiting to be filled, they can also drain of all remaining water, or topple and fall over.

The democratically governed mixed economy is *the* institutional achievement of the century, and as a social compact, it is fragile.
As @Offe2003 points out, "it is much more likely that a European-styled \[mixed economy\] capitalism transformed itself into a liberal model" than the other way around, or, appropriating Lech Walesa, "it is easier to make fish soup out of an aquarium than the other way around", because it --- like the mixed economy --- depends upon "supportive dispositions of a cognitive as well as moral kind" [-@Offe2003 446].
A mixed economy, as the democracy that governs it, is "easily lost, but never finally won", as the first African-American federal judge William H. Hastie ominously warned.

We have already lost much of the mixed economy, and we are now risking to harm or loose democracy, too:
not just democratic rule *of* the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, but democracy *in* Europe, too [@Scharpf1997 19].

Over time, the hardship that this arrangement inflicts on people, especially in the poorer, more austere [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"} (Greece), and when the imbalances and crises unload (Spain, Ireland), will corrode the inputs of popular rule, too, and fray the social contract.
@Offe2003 has already seen the grave-diggers of liberal democracy, capitalizing on the resulting popular discontent of such "permanent austerity" [@StreeckMertens2010]:

> *"Also, a third voice, luckily with much less resonance, is making itself increasingly heard in European politics, a voice which claims that the social security of workers (as well as the protection of citizens from violent crime), on the one hand, and efficiency of production and competitiveness, on the other, can only be reconciled if national borders are sealed to the influx of foreign people, foreign workers, foreign goods, and those praying to 'foreign' gods.
> Since the mid-1990s, integrating Europe has seen the sometimes sudden and spectacular rise to electoral success of figures such as Pia Kjaersgaard (Denmark), Umberto Bossi and Gianfranco Fini (Italy), Pim Fortuyn (Netherlands), with Jean Marie Le Pen (France), Jörg Haider (Austria) and Carl Hagen (Norway) being among the pioneers of this new field of populist political entrepreneurship.
> Le Pen has described himself in the 2002 French electoral campaign as being a leftist in social affairs, a rightist in economic affairs, and a nationalist for everything else.\
> This formula, which is designed to resolve the tension between liberal market freedom and welfare state status rights by ethno-nationalist, xenophobic, and anti-European appeals, is applied by his rightist populist colleagues as well.\"*\
> --- Claus @Offe2003 [454]

The ground of popular resentment will only grow more fertile as the Euro crises goes on.
The crippling economic depressions of the south, and the ever-insufficient, multi-billion bail-outs from the north are political dynamite, waiting to be ignited by fringe populists.

If the extreme right, or extreme left, and/or nationalists start playing with this fire, the moderate voices of social democracy, liberalism and conservativism will have little to douse the flames, because in fact, both the polities in the north and south *are* faced with thoroughly unattractive alternatives.

In the now often wretched south, policy makers must either accept the conditional straightjacket imposed by the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} and its rich sponsors, or jump the cliff of secession and sovereign default, all but ensuring all-out economic collapse under autarky.
In the still largely isolated north, policy makers must either continue to periodically support often (but not always) failing governments in the south to alleviate the gravest imbalances, or splinter the union and forego the years, maybe decades of economic growth that wide integration brought.

European democracies thus are also no longer *input congruent* [@Zurn-2000-aa], in addition to the already grave, but homemade democratic deficit of a heavily intergovernmentally-biased institutional setup.
Faced with such non-alternatives, the people of Europe are no longer subjected only to decisions in the making of which they had a say.
For the past two years, every couple of months, German or Greece executives, legislators and voters are asked to choose between bail-out or break-up, austerity or abyss, always at gunpoint, with the entire european project held hostage (for example, *Grexit*, followed by Portugal, Spain, Italy, followed by doomsday).
If the people of Europe merely get to choose between a rock and a hard place, popular sovereignty becomes a farce.

@Offe1998's [-@Offe1998] intuition is, tragically, fully borne out:

> *"\[...\] that every interim solutions between the extremes of intact national sovereignty on the hand, and complete european supranationalty of a European Federation will, inevitably, violate both the reference point of welfare state protection and that of democratic legitimacy."*\
> --- Claus @Offe1998 [41]
> [^15]

The political fringes will prosper, as they exploit these violations, both from the extreme left and the extreme right.
The extreme left will fan the flames of societal disintegration by pitting liberal freedoms --- especially those of property and contract! --- against welfare protection and democratic sovereignty.
Merely a change in tone, the extreme right will push societal regress by pitting all cosmopolitan integration and solidarity against always national welfare and sovereign rule.
This new game is rigged against liberal democracy and the moderate voices (or cross-cutting cleavages, @LipsetRokkan-1967-aa) on which it so thoroughly depends.

What the glass-half-full-optimists forget is that societal, political and economic integration can reverse course, too.
The self-reinforcing dynamics of integration operate in *both* directions:
more integration begets more integration (as Monnet had hoped, according to [@Schmitter1999 948], but regress also begets more regress.
As a matter of fact, the neo-functionalists are right, if one-sided (Tranholm-Mikkelsen 1991 as cited in @Bieler2003 [1])

The course of economic disintegration is quite clear:
literally the milli-second that an over-indebted [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"} is thought to leave the [emu]{acronym-label="emu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, anticipating massive devaluation, all holders of cash in, say, Greek institutions, will take their money out.
[^16]
Faced with such an economy-wide bank run, the Greek government will be forced to install capital controls, effectively leaving the common market.
Without international finance, the remaining trade, too, will be greatly constrained.
Just the credible rumor of *Grexit* could, thereby, almost in an instant, unravel 21 years of integration since the country joined in 1981.

We tread the course of political disintegration if --- outflanked by populists --- our [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"} democracies increasingly re-embrace the supposed trade-off between national interest and political unification, and again entertain the nationalist politics that the union was built to overcome, in a scenario of decay similar to that painted by [@BeckGrande-2007-aa 339ff], or [@Schmitter1999 947].

Writ large on society, this is the disintegration that @Offe1998 presciently feared in [-@Offe1998]:

> *"\[...\] one could suspect a downward descent on the ladder that T. H. [@Marshall-1950-aa] suggested as a model for european political modernization.
> The three rungs on this latter are the cumulative expansion of liberal, democratic and social rights.
> The question is, whether during the course of european integration, we will pass the democratic and welfare state stages on our way down, and, as a result, european citizens will be equipped merely with the rights of a (neo-)liberal market participant."*\

[^1]: Personal income taxes on capital necessitate a corollary taxation of corporate income.
    Without it, taxpayers could easily evade payment by incorporating capital it in a firm, withdrawing earnings only slowly.

[^2]: For example, @Beckfield2006 finds for the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}-12 that nearly half of the rise in within-country inequality between 1973 and 1997 can be explained by regional integration [-@Beckfield2006 979]:
    inequality almost everywhere in the [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"}, has been widening, at least in part due to regional integration [for example, @DaudUngl2008 265].

[^3]: @Galbraith2002a [25] precisely describes an analogous, worldwide dynamic:

    > *"In sum, it is not increasing trade *as such* that we should fear.
    > Nor is technolocy the culprit.
    > To focus on 'globalization' as such misstates the issue.
    > The problem is a process of integration carried out since at least 1980 under circumstances of unsustainable finance, in which wealth has flowed upwards from the poor countries to the rich, and mainly to the upper financial strata of the richest countries.
    > In the course of these events, progress toward tolerable levels of inequality and sustainable development virtually stopped.
    > Neocolonial patterns of center-periphery dependence, and of debt peonage, were reestablished, but without the slightest assumption of responsibility by the rich countries for the fate of the poor.
    > It has been, it would appear, a perfect crime.
    > And while statistical forensics can play a small role in pointing this out, no mechanism to reverse the policy exists, still less any that might repair the damage.
    > The developed countries have abandoned the pretense of attempting to foster development in the world at large, preferring to substitute the rhetoric of ungoverned markets for the hard work of stabilizing regulation.
    > The prognosis is grim:
    > a descent into apathy, despair, disease, ecological disaster, and wars of separatism and survival in many of the poorest parts of the world.

[^4]: For some social science that seems to physically placing "markets" in quotation marks, see, for example @Beckert2012.
    In lieu of an economic, or social scientific explanation of failing or corrupted markets for sovereign debt, this rhetorical device works to distance the social scientist from these market messengers, as if their price signals were merely social constructs.
    There is, however, such a thing as objectively given, materially tangible, unsustainable debt that higher interest rates might merely communicate [@Wihlborg2010 55].
    "Punctuation", in any event, does not replace an explanation.

[^5]: The [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} commission is quite explicit about this:

    > *"The Single Market Review put *(sic!)* citizens, consumers and [smes]{acronym-label="sme" acronym-form="plural+short"} at the centre of policy-making."*\
    > --- @Commission2008 [3]

    One wonders, at least, why, in addition to *citizens*, consumers and *some* (though not other) firms are also mentioned, when, in a functioning market, the latter two should be served only as proxies of the ultimate beneficiary, the citizen.

[^6]: To mention just a few red flags, it is unclear what costs Postwar prosperity extracted from others (dependence or world systems theory), we do know whether or how Western affluence can be repeated without the same gigantuan carbon footprint and we worry whether broad-based growth in value-add is but a historical episode (cost disease).

[^7]: For example, László Kovács (2004), then Commissioner for Taxation and Customs asked that tax rates must be allowed to differ 6-8% simply to make up for the remote location of some markets.

[^8]: Capital inflows will be particularly effective in relatively poor economies.
    As these economies, supposedly, still lie far below the golden rule of saving [@Solow1956], returns on capital will be much higher than in richer economies where further (near-Solowian) capital deepening faces diminishing returns (for example, @Barro1995 or *ibid.* 1992 as cited in [@Beckfield2009 3].

[^9]: To remind readers that this is not, in fact, what the acquis currently stipulates:
    The overall structural and cohesion funds for 2007--2013 amount to no more than € 347 billion, less than 3 times the budget of the city of Berlin (€ 21 billion in 2009), or about 0.005 % of the budget of Germany (€ 1,164,000 billion in 2011).
    In addition, [eu]{acronym-label="eu" acronym-form="singular+short"} budget negotiations are still marred by *juste retoure* attitudes, with [ms]{acronym-label="ms" acronym-form="singular+short"} wanting to get paid out what they have received --- the very opposite of a redistributive regime [for example, @Begg2008a].

[^10]: It too, is neither new nor revolutionary:
    internally heterogenous mixed economies have always, with varying results, dealt with this question.
    In the US, much of the controversy about the role of the federal government boils down to the question of how much rich Texans should dole out to poor Louisianans.
    In Italy, the rift is between North and South [for example, @PutnamLeonardi-1993-aa]) and in Germany, initially between industrial and rural states, since 1990 between old and new *Laender*.

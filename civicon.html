%random quotes from BOGGS against beans-n-rice democracy
    %The focus on the immediate, tangible, can also be understood as a deliberative way of "anti-statism" that Boggs 1997 rightfully deplores, particuarly anti-statism in the public sphere: we need to understand also the big bureaucratic machine of the state and capitalism.
%Not just the immediate.
%Boggs explicetly cites that the anti-statism sentiment also comes from and resonated "within the new left, the counter-culture, somprogressive movements" (Boggs 1997: 751).
%Boggs also hypothesizes that this revolt agaianst politics may have a stretegic value in a period of global interdependence and worsening social crisis (Boggs 1997: 752).

    %Boggs 1997: 759 criticizes this: "Those new forms of empowerment and identity that have been carved out are mostly confined to the realm of neighborhood and locale".
%"The pursuit of human-scale democracy, motivated by progressive designs, thus moves in a defensive and insular direction, laying bare a process of conservative retreat beneath the facile rhetorik of grassrppts activism".

    %Boggs again 1997 760 agrees that manu eenclages do function to challenge the status qup, but, in Plotkin's words "With its characteristically defensive, exclusionary, and reactive character, the resulting politics is a 'geopolitics of local community' in which 'deterrence, counterforce, holding ground, securing borders, flanking maneuvers and standing fast' are 'central organizing concepts'.
%Each enclave becomes a mini fortress.

    %Compare to this the Porto Allegre praising of increased localized identity.

  %There are different solutions to the problem of failing democracy and mixed economy, and they all fall short.
  %The small-scale deliberation suggestion ends up being beans n rice democracy, no large scale projects or abstractions.
  %Same thing for civil society or NGOs or whatever for economic production.
  %On the democracy side, Kaplan's solutions for both problems is to make it more like markets, but for tax, that doesn't exist, as it does not for some of the other big government jobs.
  %You can't outsource tax to markets.

%Deliberative Democracy (for example, Cohen 1989) is an alternative prescription for the pluralist political process in liberal democracies.
%It promotes egalitarian, inclusive, well-reasoned and civic-minded discussions for (possibly) consensual political decision-making.
%Its normative theory draws heavily on Habermaas’ (1984) concept of communicative action and Rawls’ (1971) “Theory of Justice” as fairness.
%Where pluralism encourages the representation of particular interest, deliberative democracy demands (alternative!, Cohen 1989: 18) conceptions of the common good.
%Where pluralism aggregates given, pre-social preferences, deliberative democracy is all about forming preferences.
%Where pluralism assumes individual voter error to balance out, when errors are random (Page and Shapiro 1993, Surowiecki 2004), deliberative democracy insists on perfecting the deliberators understandings.
%Deliberative Democracy has been implemented mostly in local settings on policies of limited scope (Fung 2003, Hendrickson & Tucker 2005), a limitation for which it has been criticized (Fung & Wright 2001: 17).
%Some attempts at deliberating regional issues of greater  complexity have been made, including a ‘Citizens Assembly’ on electoral reform in British Columbia, Canada  (cf.~Ratner 2008).
%Deliberative Polling ® (recently Fishkin 2009), the ‘Gold Standard’ of deliberative fora (Mansbridge 2010: 55), combines skillfully moderated small and plenary group discussions , rigorously vetted, balanced briefings and experts with pre-treatment, post-treatment and control group opinion surveys into a quasi-experimental design.

%Crouch 2004:3 ``It is an ideal model, which can almost never be fully achieved, but, like all impossible ideals, it sets a marker.
%It is always valuable and intensely practical to consider where our conduct stands in relation to an ideal, since in that way we can try to improve.
%It is essential to take this approach to democracy rather than the more common one, which is to scale down definitions of the ideal so that they conform to what we easily achieve.
%That way lies complacency, self-congratulation and an absence of con- cern to identify ways in which democracy is being weakened.'' this is a good quote, works well with normative hypothetical.

%Crouch 2004:3 ``A similar approach is dominating con- temporary thinking.
%Again under US influence, democ- racy is increasingly being defined as liberaldemocracy: an historically contingent form, not a normative last word (see the critical accounts of this in Dahl 1989 and Schmit- ter 2002).
%This is a form that stresses electoral participa- tion as thee main type of mass participation, extensive freedom for lobbying activities, which mainly means busi- ness lobbies, and a form of polity that avoids interfering with a capitalist economy.

<p>Deliberation is no such catalogue of first-order considerations of what would make a good (efficient, fair, sustainable) decision in any given policy field, but instead, a second-order prescription to resolve disagreement <em>over</em> those very the moral and causal arguments <span class="citation">(Gutmann and Thompson <a href="#ref-GutmannThompson-2004-aa">2004</a>, 125)</span>.
Still, and in contrast to pluralism, it places more than just <em>procedural</em> claims, but posits <em>substantive</em> requirements for how agreement must be reached.
Succinctly, <span class="citation">Gutmann and Thompson (<a href="#ref-GutmannThompson-2004-aa">2004</a>)</span> demand that “your fellow citizens must give reasons that are comprehensible to you” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-GutmannThompson-2004-aa">2004</a> K177)</span>.
More than merely intelligible, permissible arguments to reach deliberative agreement must raise validity <span class="citation">(Habermas <a href="#ref-Habermas-1984">1984</a>)</span> and moral <span class="citation">(Rawls <a href="#ref-Rawls-1971">1971</a>)</span> claims <em>universally</em> acceptable to everyone.</p>
<p>Logically, it must then be theoretically possible for any <em>given</em> argument to <em>fail</em> that test, and to be impermissible — including the arguments brought forward by experts.
In fact, deliberation reserves no special place for nominal experts at all, except if and to the extent that these experts have arrived at, and present their agreement under the standards of deliberation.</p>
<p>As noted in the above, any research design that axiomatizes any disagreement between experts (or ex-ante logic) as <em>misunderstandings</em> on the part of the non-experts fails the deliberative standard, no matter the supposedly enlightening de-biasing treatments.</p>
<p>The desiderata of taxation and deliberation are seemingly in conflict.
Taxation requires people to consider an exogenously given catalogue of abstractions, and deliberation implies that no such set of arguments can be unconditionally accepted.
This is a general contradiction of procedural and substantively epistemic formulations of deliberative democracy <span class="citation">(Bohman <a href="#ref-Bohman1998">1998</a>, 402)</span>.</p>
<p>This impasse has real repercussions for the proposed research design:
apparently, it can serve only one master.
Either, participants misunderstandings can be revealed by treating them with introductory economics, <em>or</em> they can deliberate any which arguments they themselves find comprehensible.</p>
<p>As with so much that deliberative theory is up against this is a false dichotomy.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>
<p>Argumentative reciprocity implies that expert knowledge be neither presumed, nor negated, but that these arguments — as all others — be allowed to demonstrate their universal causal and moral validity.</p>
<!-- %``Mutual justification means not merely offering reasons to other people, or even offering reasons that they happen to accept [\ldots] \citep[98]{GutmannThompson-2004-aa}.
%   It means providing reasons that constitute a justification for imposing binding laws on them.

%   Merely formal standards for mutual justification --- such as a requirement that maxims implied by laws be generalizable --- are not sufficient.%plagiarism? -->
<p>Expert- and non-expert (as all other) arguments must not merely be balanced in terms of airtime or affect, but “the considerations offered in favor of, or against, a proposal, candidate or policy <span class="math display">\[must\]</span> be answered in a substantive way by <em>those who advocate a different position</em>” <span class="citation">(Fishkin <a href="#ref-Fishkin2009">2009</a> K550, emphasis added)</span>.
Deliberation is, in other words, when non-experts answer expert arguments <em>on their own, expert terms</em>, and vice versa, too.
Surely, the relation of this ideal to practice is “aspirational”, too, as all in deliberation <span class="citation">(Fishkin <a href="#ref-Fishkin2009">2009</a> K2679)</span>.
So far, democratic theorists have failed to show “how to incorporate the need for expertise and technical administration in a deliberative democracy” <span class="citation">(Thompson <a href="#ref-Thompson2008">2008</a>, 515)</span> and “<span class="math display">\[a\]</span> great deal of work on deliberative theory focuses on conflicting values, religious toleration, identities and so on, and relatively little on conflicting facts” <span class="citation">(Moore <a href="#ref-Moore2011">2011</a>, 2)</span>.</p>
<p>Yet, for the deliberative experimenter, this aspiration to argumentative reciprocity is the ultimate hypothesis in need of falsification, including reciprocity with expert arguments.
If expert knowledge on taxation is presumed valid, and any dissent chalked up as misunderstandings the aspiration of communicative action could <em>never</em> be falsified.
Likewise, if expert knowledge on taxation is not given adequate opportunity to be reciprocally considered on its own terms, communicative action will <em>always</em> be violated.
Neither of those formats would provide construct-valid deliberation.
Expert knowledge is then “a special case of the general problem of convincing those who are not ‘in the room’ to accept the results of a deliberation in which they did not directly participate” <span class="citation">(Moore <a href="#ref-Moore2011">2011</a>, 2)</span>.
This problem can only be resolved by a “democratic conception of expert authority” <span class="citation">(Moore <a href="#ref-Moore2011">2011</a>, 2)</span>, that is, if deliberative standards are extended to expert arguments, too.
A good deliberative format brings ordinary citizens into this business:
they must be enabled to the farthest extent possible to argue expert as well as non-expert claims on their own terms, including the possibility to reject expert opinion if it is found insufficiently reciprocal in argument.</p>
<p>Because bringing ordinary citizens into this business, and <em>equally</em> so, is, as <span class="citation">Rosenberg (<a href="#ref-Rosenberg-2002-aa">2002</a>)</span>’s so difficult, deliberations must “be regarded as remedial institutions” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Rosenberg-2007-aa">2007</a>, 12)</span> and more, “they must be sites for political education and development” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Rosenberg-2007-aa">2007</a>, 13)</span>.</p>

<!-- % \subsection{Political Psychology}
% Communicative action is very demanding of the cognitive and moral faculties of deliberators.
% Political psychologists have problematized these demands that deliberation poses \citep{Rosenberg-2002-aa} --- especially, but not only, deliberation of highly abstract topics.
% Troublingly for deliberative democracy of the Habermasian kind, recent research in political psychology suggests, that --- contrary to the bounded rationality assumption \citep[for example,][]{Simon-1999-aa,Kahneman2011} --- imperfect human reasoning may not only stem from remediable cognitive scarcity, but may be developmentally determined.
% \citet{Rosenberg-2002-aa} has proposed a threefold developmental sequence and typology of \emph{sequential}, \emph{linear} and \emph{systematic} reasoning.
% %TODO add better rosenberg references
% His empirical accounts suggest that if any, only systematic thinkers will be able to meet the cognitive demands for reasoned arguments, and egalitarian free speech of deliberative democracy.
% Moreover, this cognitive competence was found \emph{not} to be domain specific, and while people may regress to lower levels of competence under high loads or appropriate cues, they are unlikely to easily, if ever, achieve higher than developed levels.
% ``Structurally (more and) less developed reasoning adults'' make ``not only the adequacy of citizens' reasoning, but also their \emph{equality}'' a problem for deliberative democracy \citep[12, emphasis added]{Rosenberg-2007-aa}.

% On this red flag, too, much of deliberative practice is silent.
% While deliberative formats routinely strive to attract diverse participants and ensure their equal participation \citep{Fishkin2009}, they rarely problematize, or measure the substantive, argumentative \emph{equality} of participants.
% Among the small research that has looked into argumentative equality of actual (\gls{dp}) proceedings, \cite{Siu} finds that information, rather than education of participants is related to argument quality \emph{at the small group level}, but offers no individual-level analysis.
% There is also yet --- to my knowledge --- no research that tracks how limited and unequal capacities for moral and causal reasoning may filter up to understandings of, and preferences over complex policy issues.
% Here, too, taxation is a good case to test the promise of deliberative fora:
% it demands both advanced moral and causal reasoning, and raises controversies and tradeoffs likely to impact the life-chances of people along similar socio-economic dimensions as those related to cognitive competence.

% Based on his sobering findings, \citet[20]{Rosenberg-2007-aa} also suggests a revised understanding of deliberation:

% \begin{quotation}
%   \emph{``Deliberative fora must not be regarded simply as empty stages that provide a venue for the realization of citizenship;
%   nor must the design of these deliberative stages focus simply on the removal of obstructions that may inhibit freedom or give unequal scope for maneuver.
%   Instead, deliberation must be understood as a site for the construction and transformation of citizenship.
%   In deliberation, citizens are made as well as realized.
%   The operative metaphor here is that of a school, but of particular kind.
%   The educational goal is not the transmission of specific beliefs and values, although these are by no means irrelevant.
%   Rather the central aim must be to foster the requisite cognitive development for a fuller autonomy, a greater communicative competence and a better ability to engage in a collaborative effort to make good and just public policy.''}
%   \\*

% \end{quotation}

% This ``reforming'' variant of \citeauthor{Habermas-1984}' vision --- informed by empirical facts about our time, and our people --- also bears on the analysis and operationalization of deliberation.
% \emph{School}, as \citeauthor{Rosenberg-2007-aa} reminds us, is the ``operative metaphor'', one that balances furthering of equality and citizens' autonomy.

%note that the link between rosenbergs sequence thinking and my tax misunderstandings is still to be developed -->
<!-- %Rosenberg 2007:
%Rosenberg has the radical inter-subjective formulation that I think I'm looking for:
    %6:
%``In this deliberative conception, equality and autonomy require each other.
%On the one hand, equality is a necessary precondition of autonomy.
%It is only in a cooperative exchange between equals that the self-expression and critical selfreflection required for the self-reflective construction of one’s understandings and interests is possible.
    %10 Where the self dominates, self-criticism truncates and narrows.
%Where the other dominates, self-expression is suppressed.
%In either case, the self that is constructed is a distortion and any true autonomy is compromised.
%On the other hand, equality requires autonomy.
%Deliberative equality is equality of effective participation.11
    %10:
%Developmental psychology raises further questions regarding the adequacy of deliberative theorists’ characterization of cognition.
%In the deliberative democracy literature (and in most social psychological research), cognition is typically conceived as a universally shared set of distinct skills or capacities.
%Following the work of Piaget27 and Vygotsky,28 the research on cognitive development offers a more integrative and differentiated view of cognition.
%Cognition is not regarded simply as a matter of calculation or arranging representations, but more essentially as a constructive activity.
%This is understood in pragmatic terms, that is, with reference to an individual’s attempt to operate on the world around her.
%In this attempt, the individual conceives of the acts, items and people involved in term of the role each plays in her purposive activity

%In this sense, the research suggests that deliberations be regarded as remedial institutions

<!-- %\paragraph{Chicago Devolution}The almost microscopic devolution in the Chicago Police Department (CPD) or the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) are insightful examples plagued by crass incongruences of political, social and economic spaces.
%While not explicitly deliberative formats, both innovations sought to improve inclusion, dialogue, and equality \citep{Fung-2003-aa}.

% The revamped CPD sought to cooperate with residents \emph{on a neighborhood}-level to identify and to fight --- not prevent --- crime herds.
%By its very focusing on police ridings, it made larger-scale, macro determinants of crime invisible, and outside the scope of debate:
%income inequality, or zoning laws, to name just two of the factors otherwise so glaringly discernible in Chicago, itself almost the epitome of a decaying inner city\footnote{Both of these factors, incidentally, would not even need a truly macro perspective to become potentially visible, as they are already visible on a metropolitan level.}.

%In Public Schooling, Chicago reinvigorated \emph{school-based} Parent-Teacher Associations, re-trained and coached staff and teachers and installed systematic performance management ``by comparing their methods with those of \emph{similarly situated but better-performing schools}'' (\citealt{Fung-2003-aa}:
%124, emphasis added).
%No mentioning is made of comparisons with surrounding suburban Illinois or urban charter schools, which may have enabled an understanding of the structural factors influencing a school's success or may have exposed the gross differences in scholastic aptitude with students ``not similarly situated''.
%Or, one hypothesizes, such comprehensive analyses may even put the effect of school management in a humbling juxtaposition against other, more powerful macro-level factors. -->
<!-- %There is no reason to belittle the efforts of these brave \emph{Don Quixotes}, working and participating to improve their surroundings in the schools and police stations of Chicago.
%Many of them have demonstrated substantial results \citep{Fung-2003-aa}.
%But given the ``macro windmills'' grossly outmatching these deliberators --- windmills over which, under the current design they have no control or even mandated discourse --- they are destined to fail in their democratic decision-making.
%Congruency between inputs, that is, what deliberators can discuss and decide on, and the outputs, that is, the social and economic reality to which they respond, is violated.
%Even basic democratic criteria of accountability and responsibility for political decisions and outcomes (like the ``within-slum'' performance management) have no meaning in this context. -->
<!-- %\paragraph{Participatory Budgeting} Much lauded Participatory Budgeting (PB), pioneered in Porto Allegre, Brasil, is another example for the intricacies and dangers of deliberative devolution from a transition economy setting.
%Under PB, local community and organization representatives cooperate with city government in deliberative fora, both at the neighborhood level and in thematic groups.
%Using a sophisticated rating and decision procedure they allocate much of the city governments investments.
%Observer \citet{Sousa-Santos-1998-aa} notes how PB contributes to a ''counterhegemonic globalization'' by concentrating on special issues like land rights, urban infrastructure and drinking water in urban settings.
%He, like few other writers on deliberative designs and PB in particular, is aware of the resulting danger that PB projects remain ``Bean 'n Rice Works'', ``formulae for solving a few of the urgent problems affecting the popular classes, perhaps a less clientelist version than the traditionalist one, but no less imediatist and electoralist'' (\citealt{Sousa-Santos-1998-aa}:
%479).
%Also, he points to the threats posed to PB by the 1998 financial crisis in Brazil, and wonders whether PB will still be possible ``when the material results turn out to be less anchored in the immediate needs of the regions'' (ibid.:
%495) and how distributive justice will still be possible under increased functional differentiation -->
<!-- %\paragraph{Identity} Another way to look at the inadequacy of small-scale deliberation is to question the identity formation that undergirds it.
%As is often cited self-confidently, devolved deliberation is praised to be ``carved out of (\ldots) the realm of neighborhood and locale''(\citealt{Boggs-1997-aa}:
%751).
%Just some etymological intuition --- neighbor\emph{hood}, \emph{community} (living together), \emph{the local} people --- suggests a bias towards a smaller scale, identities of which, for some reason seem to be more valuable than others.

%Of course, a ``neighborhood'', for the most part --- except actual acquaintances --- is no more or less of an ``Imagined Community'' \citep{Anderson-1983-aa}, no less constructed and contingent \citep{Gellner-1983-aa} than a Nation State, or ``The International Community'', for that matter.
%``Mechanical Solidarity'' \citep{Durkheim-1893-aa}, the only kind that would justify the immediate, the local, has through multifaceted integration and functional differentiation long given way to ``Organic'' --- if any --- Solidarity, where interdependencies run far.
%And where modern technology has brought great mobility, locality, is, as Simmel \citeyear{Simmel-1917-aa} said (of boundaries) ``not a spatial fact with sociological effects, but a sociological fact which forms spatially".
%There is then no particular reason to focus on local policy making --- but highly problematic consequences, as is argued in the following. -->
<!-- %\paragraph{Macro-Level Abstractions} As the majority of theorists write, deliberation depends on a rational orientation towards the common good.
%To argue well, and with the public good in mind then, necessitates a good understanding of causal relationships ruling our social world.

%By its very definition, under modernity, these causal relationships are complex and the interdependencies run far.
%Good deliberation thus \emph{has to} transcend the immediate, the tangible and the local and to render accessible all the complex connections that functional differentiation binds.

%The described, excessively immediatist micro-focus is inadequate under modernity.
%It disallows deliberators both to understand, and to change all but a tiny portion of what determines their circumstances. -->
<!-- %\paragraph{Freedom From vs.
%Freedom To} It was, and still is, the promise of deliberative democracy to transcend the old trade-off between freedom \emph{from} and freedom \emph{to}.
%Sadly, a deliberative democracy that does not render sufficiently accessible macro-level abstractions is likely to sustain the bias towards negative freedoms of liberal democracy, which \begin{quote} ``may make it very difficult to mobilize citizens to accomplish what they collectively value most positively, but these rights and powers do insure them from suffering from what they collectively value most negatively, i.e.
%tyranny --- whether exercised by a zealous minority or an intolerant majority'' (\citealt{Schmitter-2000-aa}:
%28) \end{quote}.
%Two things are important to note about deliberative democracy and a possibly sustained liberal bias. -->
<!-- %First, The micro-macro dichotomy and and the rift between negative and positive freedoms are related:
%negative freedoms are protected by \emph{individual} rights, which by their very definition assume, and guarantee a degree of independence from broader, macro-level interrelations.
%The right to property, to ``pursue happiness'', or even --- less obviously liberal --- to form a political association (\emph{or not to}), all protect the individual from a possibly imposing collective good (or evil)\footnote{The anti-totalitarian, humanist and protective impetus of liberalism are not to be belittled here.
%Enshrined negative freedoms are a great achievement, particularly in a country like Germany, where a frenzied, putatively common good has at least once brought untold sorrow.
%The lessons of this experience notwithstanding, it is held here, that the needs have shifted in post-industrial society:
%negative freedoms, for the most part (possible exception of privacy) is largely uncontested, and antecedent values and institutions are strong and deeply rooted.
%As modernization progressed, however, positive freedoms have not grown equally.
%Much of the postindustrial world sees rising income inequalities, and even more dramatically, decreasing social mobility.}.
%Positive freedoms, on the other hand, require \emph{collective} organization to reach desirable outcomes.
%This collective organization needs to be ``congruent'' over the social, economic and political sphere.
%In micro-level deliberations, as I have tried to show, this is easily not the case, tilting the balance towards negative freedoms.

%Secondly, and more critically, the liberal trade-off between positive and negative freedoms has important equity implications.
%The balance between positive and negative freedoms is highly consequential, for they are not equally valuable to everyone.
%To put it blandly, rich people, who have much to protect and little to gain from affirmative and redistributive policy, value negative freedom more and are skeptical of positive freedom.
%While poor people certainly hold most negative freedoms equally dearly as the rich, some of them (pursuit of happiness) may not have much practical meaning under dire circumstances and others (right to property) may be opposed to their re-distributional needs.

%The above-mentioned devolution in the Chicago Police Department is a intriguing example of promoting negative freedom in at least two ways.
%First, it renders the distributional determinants of crime (decaying, impoverished inner cities) invisible.
%Secondly, it focuses our attention and decision-making on crime, more specifically, an law enforcement, not prevention --- quite the essence of promoting negative freedom. -->
<!-- %\paragraph{Do-It-\emph{Yourself} Democracy} As a corollary of its liberal, somewhat uncritical bias, small-scale deliberation also tends to be anti-statist.
%Taking up some of the anti-authoritarian, anti-bureaucratic, anti-functional-differentiation impetus of post-'68 left counter-culture, progressive and new social movements, current deliberative efforts tend to focus on the immediate, tangible and ``confined to the realm of neighborhood and locale'', not just out of necessity, but out of conviction (\citealt{Boggs-1997-aa}:
%759).

%The very essence of Weberian (\citeyear{Weber-1958-ab} rationalized authority to enable collective action in the face of highly integrated economic production, embodied --- at least for the time being --- mostly in the state, thus comes under attack.
%This cherishing of ``human-scale democracy''over all else, the donning of a large, necessarily anonymous and formalized bureaucracy, Boggs (ibid.) rightly fears, may move democracy ``in a defensive and insular direction, laying bare a process of conservative retreat beneath a facile rhetoric of grassroots activism''. -->
<!-- %Boggs (\citeyear{Boggs-1997-aa}:
%752) goes one step further and even conspires that this revolt against the state may have hegemonically ``strategic value in a period of global interdependence and worsening social crisis''. -->
<!-- \citeyear{Eliasoph-2001-aa} flamingly polemic account of how an exclusive concentration on the do-able, the small-scale, the consequentially less political, creates dynamics of an outright ``Culture of Political Avoidance'' and escapism is enlightening.

%A more disinterested, and systematic explanation of this dynamic comes from the theory of \emph{Successfully Failing Organizations} where, when faced with excessively costly challenges, organizations may choose ineffective, but symbolic policies the failure of which cannot, and will not be systematically detected.
%Such examination and oversight of agents (governors), it is argued, is not desired even by principals (the governed), precisely because its likely revelation of failure would necessitate a greater allocation (vulgo:
%redistribution) of resources \citep{Seibel-1996-aa}.
%Failure then becomes successful in that it sustains the status quo, and those who have material stakes therein. -->

<!-- %\paragraph{The Not-So-Common Sense} Recent research in political psychology suggests, that --- contrary to the bounded rationality assumption --- imperfect human reasoning may not only stem from remediable cognitive scarcity, but may be developmentally determined.
%Rosenberg (\citeyear{Rosenberg-2007-aa, Rosenberg-2002-aa, RosenbergWinterstein-2008-aa, Rosenberg-2003-aa}) has suggested a threefold developmental sequence and typology of \emph{sequential}, \emph{linear} and \emph{systematic} reasoning.
%His empirical accounts suggest that if any, only systematic thinkers will be able to meet the cognitive demands for reasoned arguments, and egalitarian free speech of deliberative democracy.
%Moreover, this cognitive competence was found not to be domain specific, and while people may regress to lower levels of competence under high loads or appropriate cues, they are unlikely to easily, if ever, achieve higher than developed levels.
%``Structurally (more and) less developed reasoning adults'' make then ``not only the adequacy of citizens' reasoning, but also their equality'' a problem for deliberative democracy (\citealt{Rosenberg-2007-aa}:
%12).

%This empirical finding resonates well with some anecdotal frustrations in deliberative settings, for example in participatory health administration:
%\begin{quote}
%``The tendency of citizens to construct their arguments in a way that is regarded as unstructured, combined with their focus on highly localized issues, makes their speeches appear unclear, emotional, disruptive or irrelevant to most representatives of the other sectors.
%Moreover, this style of speech tends to be associated with poorer and less educated people, and it is regarded as not only ineffective, but also virtually unintelligible''.
%\end{quote}

%The conclusion Rosenberg draws from this is as skeptical, as it is ambitious.
%He suggests that ``deliberations must be more than remedial, they must be sites for political education and development'' (\citeyear{Rosenberg-2007-aa}:
%13).
%If they fail, so will quality of reasoning in deliberation and equality. -->

<!-- %Deliberative proposals in general, by virtue of their focus on reasoned arguments, have been charged to embody and essentially impoverished, positivist and thereby ``male'' outlook on the world, particularly from feminist critics \citep{Young-1996-aa}.
%The above discussion, expanding demands for a universal rationality and outright promoting macro-level abstractions is subject to the same criticism.

%A full-blown discussion of the epistemological justification of feminist theory, or relativism, is beyond the scope of this essay and unfortunately beyond my command of the relevant literature.
%A response to this criticism thus has to remain regrettably sketchy.

%\paragraph{The Blinders of Rationality} Its uneasily essentializing, groupist outlook notwithstanding (see further \citealt{Brubaker-2002-aa}), the feminist critique rightfully points to a number of blind spots of deliberation, and, by extension, blind spots of modern rationality.
%To widen the horizon again, Young (\citeyear{Young-1996-aa}:
%130) suggests to relativize rationality, and to allow for rhetoric, storytelling and ``greetings'' by which she means a ``care-taking, deferential, polite acknowledgement of the Otherness of other''.

%Also, she fears, universal rationality sustains hegemonic discourses, and limits our social imagination, as for example the nearly unchallenged postindustrial necessity of individual car mobility (\citealt{Young-2001-aa}:
%687). -->
<!-- %\paragraph{Enlightening the Blind Spots} These blind spots, a modern rationality that takes due regard of the human condition, \emph{can} illuminate, \emph{enlighten}.
%There is nothing quintessentially disregarding of individual experience in modern rationality.
%Correctly understood, rationality points us to the universalized abstractions (for example, the distribution of means of production, productivity, market efficiency) which always condition individual experience in the modern, integrated world.

%Modern rationality does not and should not claim that these constitute exclusive, comprehensively exhaustive or sufficient determinations of individual experience, but they are certainly a \emph{necessary} condition.
%Sometimes, the feminist insistence on individual, ``other'' experiences may actually serve well to perfect a universal rationality, for example, when it questions otherwise hegemonic discourses (`a car for everyone').

%Feminist critics, as I believe all social theoreticians, have to somehow further thinking about the world that enables people, and that enables progress.
%In this context, that means, they have to respond to the certain consequences of modern integration for the individual experience.
%They, and more positivist ventures no less, are obligated to \emph{integrate} the individual experience, its virtues and incomparability, wherever possible.
%But nothing fruitful follows, when the two perspectives are uncompromisingly opposed as mutually exclusive.
%No one is better off, and no one is empowered.

%\paragraph{No Reason Over Power Without Reason} In their discussion of deliberative democracy, feminist critics should pay due regard to its quintessential innovation:
%\emph{reason over power}(\citealt{Young-1996-aa}:
%122).
%This not only describes a historical narrative, but also a functional necessity.
%To overcome ``power'' of plurally organized, but self-interested, and thereby always \emph{particular} agents as justification for aggregated decisions, \emph{some universal} criterion to negate particular claims is required.

%Feminists, it appears, are opposed to this trade-off and believe we can leapfrog to an egalitarian \emph{and} particular utopia, which I think, for once is not only unlikely optimistic, but also, as of yet, inconclusive\footnote{Somewhat surprisingly, \citet{Young-2001-aa} speaks in favor of confrontational political activism of the subaltern elsewhere.
%This stands in an uneasy contrast with her, and the deliberative project's ambition to rid political decision-making of power.
%She argues, forcefully that `to have the subaltern speak \citep{Spivak-1988-aa}, they may have to shout first', before they deliberate.
%This familiar ``overrun'' vs.
%``overcome''dichotomy is not new, well known from the Civil Rights struggle in the U.S..
%The risk is that its main proposition to ``overrun'' old power structures before they can be ``overcome'' may counteract the fundamental, and universal delegitimization of power claims on which deliberation rests.}.

%For now, what remains --- or prevails --- when power is delegitimized, and reason relativized, as the Feminist critique suggests?
%My hunch would be:
%power wins.
%And that, from an enlightened positivist perspective, as well as from emancipative or critical theory viewpoints, cannot be desirable.

%The solution, in \citet{Rawls-1971} operative metaphor, must be to perfect the ``veil of ignorance'' towards power --- not towards individual experience, of necessity --- and to replace it with a human-faced rationality. -->

%This is a hope that may well be justified, in part.

    %Habermas, on the other hand seems to argue that deliberators can't get into the business of government anyway.
    %"communicative action, is action oriented to reaching understanding" (Habermas 1996, Norms and Facts)

    %Social coordination through communicative action is possible, Habermas argues, in societies characterized by ‘strong archaic institutions’ and ‘small and relatively undifferentiated groups’ (Habermas, 1996, p.
%25).
%This is because communicative action always takes place against the backdrop of a shared lifeworld, which in traditional societies provides ‘a reservoir of taken for granteds, of unshaken convictions that participants in communication draw upon in cooperative processes of interpretation’ and from which ‘processes of reaching understanding get shaped’ (Habermas, 1987, pp.
%124 and 125, respectively).

    %However, coordination through communicative action becomes improbable in post-traditional societies, due to the emergence (strictly related to rationalization and modernity) of self-centred action based on strategic calculations.
%In these societies, ‘in which unfettered communicative action can neither unload nor seriously bear the burden of social integration falling to it’ (Habermas, 1996, p.
%37), law emerges as a functional necessity exactly to ‘lighten the tasks of social integration for actors whose capacities for reaching understanding are overtaxed’ (Habermas, 1996, p.
%34).

    %6It should be noted that some of the discourses which are produced in the informal public sphere conform poorly to the ‘gentlemen’s club’ model featured in some theories of deliberation (i.e.
%rational, poised and articulate), which, according to critics, ‘involves communication in the terms set by the powerful’ (Dryzek, 2000, p.
%70), and resemble much more the ‘agonistic’, partisan discourses of a trial setting.
%Groups do not seek to persuade each other but seek to influence the court of public opinion by forcefully asserting the issues, values and interpretations that they believe should be binding for everybody, sometimes even through ‘sensational actions, mass protests, and incessant campaigning’ (Habermas, 1996, p.
%381).

    %This characterization shares with critics of deliberation, in particular with Carl Schmitt’s Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy (1985), and Habermas’ own earlier work (for example, 1989), a stance of low expectation about the possibility of deliberation in formal settings, and it sees action aimed at reaching understanding as more likely to occur in the informal public sphere, where the preferences of ordinary citizens are still malleable, pragmatic constraints as to what is possible and feasible are less pressing, and the possibility for civil society groups to build communicative power by articulating moral alternatives to the

%"In contrast to this and other aggregative conceptions, the ideal of de- liberative democracy says that in voting it is the role, perhaps the duty, of democratic citizens to express their impartial judgments of what conduces to the common good of all citizens, and not their personal pref- erences based on judgments of how measures affect their individual or group interests"

    %Bingo377:
%here's the disagreement with Fishkin:
%" No reasonable conception of democracy would advise us to vote without thinking at all about how alternatives might affect relevant in- terests (whether our personal interests or the common interest).
%This would be irrational.
%In this regard what distinguishes deliberative from aggregative conceptions is not deliberation per se, nor the fact that one involves voting but the other does not (contrast Przeworski, DD2).

    %ibid 388 calls this the difference between procedural and epistemic views of democracy.Procedural views emphasize fairness of demo- cratic procedures, whereas epistemic views emphasize substantive jus- tice of outcomes.
%A pure procedural conception of democracy has no standard independent of the voting procedure itself to determine the justice of outcomes.36 A pure epistemic conception says that justice is entirely independent of procedures for deciding what is just, so that the procedure that best approximates substantive justice is itself right (le- gitimate or just).

    %There's hope for disagreeing, not tolerating stuff:
%ok:
%401:
%"Rawls's ideal of public reason then responds to the "fact of reasonable pluralism." Reasonable pluralism-not pluralism per se-defines the pa- rameters and the reach of public reason.
%This means three things (at least).
%first, Rawls's idea of public reason does not rely on autonomy or any other "comprehensive" account of the human good;
%nor does it depend on an account of the origin of moral duty (in reason, emotion, or God's wis- dom or will.) The idea that autonomy, God, utility, human perfection, or some other comprehensive value, is a condition of justice and the hu- man good must be given up within public reasoning, for these values cannot provide bases for agreement on a common good among demo- cratic citizens "

    %402:
%"Whereas expression of such unreasonable views is to be tolerated, their effects are to be contained by society.

%If people have little background information, then foregrounding particular facts may be persuasive when people have no idea of the broader context.
%Clean coal advocates make a powerful case for the benefits of clean coal compared to dirty coal, but the mass public has little idea that clean coal is much dirtier than natural gas (as well as other alternatives like renewable energy).
%Selective invocation of true facts (such as that clean coal is cleaner than dirty coal) without a context where those facts can be compared to others (how clean coal compares to other energy alternatives) can allow advocates to manipulate opinion.10 Third, when people have little information they may easily fall prey to misinformation.

%Fifth, another key strategy of manipulation is to "prime" one aspect of a policy, making that dimension so salient that it overwhelms other considerations.

%The idea of microcosmic deliberation is to take a relatively small, face-to-face group which everyone has an equal chance of being part of, and provide it with good conditions for deliberating on some policy or political issue.
%Citizens Juries, like Deliberative Polls use public opinion research methods to gather a sample to deliberate.
%But the Citizens Jury is more akin to a single discussion group in that the size is comparable to that of a modern jury-twelve or perhaps eighteen or twenty-four.34 A benefit of such a group is that it can continue to meet in a local community for an extended period, sometimes for several days or on successive weekends.
%The "jurors" hear testimony, call witnesses, ask for evidence, and at some point come up with recommendations to some local or governmental authority.
%The limitation of the process is that with such small numbers it is not possible to establish the statistical representativeness of the deliberating group.
%Citizens juries are too small for there to be a scientific basis for connecting their conclusions to the hypothetical informed opinion of an entire society, to what the country would decide if it were better informed-even though the results of Citizens juries are often represented in that way.
%However, the now extensive experience in both the United States and the United Kingdom with Citizens juries adds to our picture of citizen competence with complex policy issues-once citizens find themselves in a social context that supports deliberation.35 Read more at location 843   • Delete this highlight

%Our other focus for how to fill out Quadrant II, microcosmic deliberation, is a very old practice, but one that has only recently revived.
%If it is to acquire credibility, it needs buttressing with systematic investigation.
%Social science can be employed to give credibility to the claim that a particular strategy of institutional design has been realized to give expression to deliberative democracy-to the combination of political equality and deliberation.
%The aspiration is to undertake a research agenda that credibly explores the conditions under which deliberation might be realized by ordinary citizens who constitute a credible microcosm.
%The tighter this connection, the more transparent it is;
%the more evidence there is that it has been achieved without distortion, the more force there is to the claim that we can accept a realization of what the people would think (Quadrant II), rather than what they actually do think when they are not thinking very much (Quadrant IV).

%The problem is that any microcosmic deliberation taking place in a modern developed society will be one in which there are significant social and economic inequalities in the conduct of ordinary life in the broader society.
%It seems difficult or impossible to "bracket" these inequalities-for participants to behave "as if" they do not exist.6 Indeed the problem goes deeper.

%Gutman, the book:

%1) Its first and most important characteristic, then, is its reason-giving requirement.
%The reasons that deliberative democracy asks citizens and their representatives to give should appeal to principles that individuals who are trying to find fair terms of cooperation cannot reasonably reject.
%The reasons are neither merely procedural (“because the majority favors the war”) nor purely substantive (“because the war promotes the national interest or world peace”).
%They are reasons that should be accepted by free and equal persons seeking fair terms of cooperation.Read more at location 163   • Delete this highlight

%2)  second characteristic of deliberative democracy is that the reasons given in this process should be accessible to all the citizens to whom they are addressed.
%To justify imposing their will on you, your fellow citizens must give reasons that are comprehensible to you.
%If you seek to impose your will on them, you owe them no less.
%This form of reciprocity means that the reasons must be public in two senses.
%First, the deliberation itself must take place in public, not merely in the privacy of one’s mind.
%In this respect deliberative democracy stands in contrast to Rousseau’s conception of democracy, in which individuals reflect on their own on what is right for the society as a whole, and then come to the assembly and vote in accordance with the general will.2 The other sense in which the reasons must be public concerns their content.
%A deliberative justification does not even get started if those to whom it is addressed cannot understand its essential content.
%It would not be acceptable, for example, to appeal only to the authority of revelation, whether divine or secular in nature.Read more at location 177   • Delete this highlight

%3) The third characteristic of deliberative democracy is that its process aims at producing a decision that is binding for some period of time.
%In this respect the deliberative process is not like a talk show or an academic seminar.
%The participants do not argue for argument’s sake;
%they do not argue even for truth’s own sake (although the truthfulness of their arguments is a deliberative virtue because it is a necessary aim in justifying their decision).
%They intend their discussion to influence a decision the government will make, or a process that will affect how future decisions areRead more at location 199   • Delete this highlight

%4) This continuation of debate illustrates the fourth characteristic of deliberative democracy—its process is dynamic.
%Although deliberation aims at a justifiable decision, it does not presuppose that the decision at hand will in fact be justified, let alone that a justification today will suffice for the indefinite future.
%It keeps open the possibility of a continuing dialogue, one in which citizens can criticize previous decisions and move ahead on the basis of that criticism.
%Although a decision must stand for some period of time, it is provisional in the sense that it must be open to challenge at some point in the future.
%This characteristic of deliberative democracy is neglected even by most of its proponents.Read more at location 212   • Delete this highlight

%Practicing the economy of moral disagreement promotes the value of mutual respect (which is at the core of deliberative democracy).

%Mutual justification means not merely offering reasons to other people, or even offering reasons that they happen to accept (for example, because they are in a weak bargaining position).
%It means providing reasons that constitute a justification for imposing binding laws on them.
%What reasons count as such a justification is inescapably a substantive question.
%Merely formal standards for mutual justification—such as a requirement that the maxims implied by laws be generalizable—are not sufficient.
%If the maxim happens to be “maximize self-or group-interest, ” generalizing it does not ensure that justification is mutual.
%Something similar could be said about all other conceivable candidates for formal standards.
%Mutual justification requires reference to substantive values.
%We can see more clearly why mutual justification cannot proceed without relying on substantive values by imagining any set of reasons that would deny persons basic opportunities, such as equal suffrage and essential health care.
%Even if the reasons satisfied formal standards, they could not constitute a mutual justification because those deprived of the basic opportunities could reasonably reject them.
%Denying some persons suffrage is a procedural deprivation that is inconsistent with reciprocity:
%we cannot justify coercive laws to persons who had no share in making them.
%Similarly, denying persons essential health care is a substantive deprivation that cannot be justified to the individuals who need it.
%That such denials are unacceptable shows that the mutual justification is neither purely formal nor purely procedural.Read more at location 1823   • Delete this highlight

%An important implication of reciprocity is that democratic deliberation—the process of mutual reason-giving—is not equivalent to the hypothetical justifications proposed by some social contract theories.
%Such justifications may constitute part of the moral reasoning to which some citizens appeal, but the reasoning must survive the test of actual deliberation if it is to ground laws that actually bind all citizens.
%Moreover, deliberation should take place not only in the private homes of citizens or the studies of philosophers but in public political forums.

%The criterion of mutually respectful reasoning helps distinguish a reciprocal perspective from another kind of moral perspective, which bases itself on the criterion of impartiality.
%Reciprocity stands between prudence, which demands less from justifications, and impartiality, which demands more.
%Impartiality insists that reasons be impersonal.
%It requires citizens to suppress their own personal perspectives and partial projects when setting social policies and procedures.
%The prime example of an impartialist approach is utilitarianism.
%In practice, it favors expert decision-making and implies that the medical professionals in DesertHealth should have the final say as long as their judgment is consistent with general professional opinion.
%The preferred impartialist method is neither bargaining nor deliberation, but demonstration, which aims as far as possible to establish the truth of a comprehensive moral view.
%In the face of moral disagreement, impartiality tells citizens and officials that they should affirm the view most consistent with the true morality as determined by impersonal justification.
%There is no further moral need for mutual respect or for actual political deliberation.
%The trouble with impartiality is that it does not take moral disagreement seriously enough.
%More precisely, it fails to provide a satisfactory way to deal with the moral disagreements that inevitably remain on many issues when expert opinion on the technical and medical problems or the demonstration by a comprehensive moral philosophy such as utilitarianism are complete.
%In the face of a fundamental moral disagreement such as funding fetal-tissue research, expensive organ transplants, or experimental diagnostic tests such as PUREPAP, the impartialist approach can declare only one side (or no side) correct.
%If one side is correct, it provides no reasons for recognizing moral value on the other side.
%It therefore offers no way, other than agreement, for the other side to respect the decision on moral grounds.Read more at location 2742   • Delete this highlight

%There are, Fishkin notes, “normally strong disincentives for mass public opinion to be very deliberative.” 11 These can range simply from what economists would call the “search costs” involved in becoming suitably informed about public issues to the collective-action problems, also much emphasized by economists, that promote “free-riding” by most of the public on the relatively small number of individuals who are willing to invest their scarce time and energy (and money) into the demands of genuine republican citizenship.

%Fishkin is no utopian.
%Indeed, a very important part of his argument is that one must choose among the horns of his trilemma.
%There is, therefore, the sad realization that “the fundamental principles of democracy do not add up to such a single, coherent ideal to be appropriated, step by step.
%… Achieving political equality and participation leads to a thin, plebiscitary democracy in which deliberation is undermined.
%Achieving political equality and deliberation leaves out mass participation.
%Achieving deliberation and participation can be achieved for those unequally motivated and interested, but violates political equality.” 13

%BINGO:
%71 Furthermore, much political theory under the influence of economic modelsof reasoning in particular proceeds from a methodological fiction:
%this is .
% the methodological fiction of an individual with an ordered set of coherent preferences.
%This fiction does not have much relevance in the political world.On complex social and political issues, more often than not, individuals may have views and wishes but no ordered set of preferences, since the latter would imply that they would be enlightened not only about the preferences but about the consequences and relative merits of each of their preferred choices in advance.
%It is actually the deliberative process itself that is likely to produce such an outcome by leading the individual to further critical reflection on his already held views and opinions;
%it is incoherent to assume that individuals can start a process of public deliberation with a level of conceptual clarity about their choices and preferences that can actually result only from a successful process of deliberation.
%Likewise, the formation of coherent preferences cannot precede deliberation;
%it can only succeed it.
%Very often individuals' wishes as well as views and opinions conflict with one another.
%In the course of deliberation and the exchange of views with others, individuals become more aware of such conflicts and feel compelled to undertake a coherent ordering.

%Elster says this:
%the better analogy for politics may be engineering, not science.
%It's not so much ultimate truth, but somethign that'll do.

%Elster:
%"the importance of time in political life implies that, in addition to deliberation, voting as well as bargaining inevitably has some part to play"

%Tilly has this (somewhat obscure) argument that tax and democracy belong together;
%without tax compliance there can be no support.

%Involvement of ordinary people aected by these problems and ocials close to them
    %3.
%The deliberative development of solutions to these problems.   (ibid., all emphases added)

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Format</h2>
<p>Consequently, a good format for deliberating tax includes a strong learning component, where participants are introduced to the structured choices and relevant abstractions suggested by experts, including their disagreements, conditions and uncertainties.
Deliberators are unlikely to cover these extensive grounds by themselves, or pick them up from (very limited) briefing books and will benefit from well-planned lessons.
On the other hand, a good format must also feature extensive small-group discussion, where participants talk amongst themselves, shielded from the authority of expertise.
Deliberators may benefit from a trained, non-expert moderator and/or scribe to assist, structure and document their discussion.
Most importantly, participants must be encouraged to adjudicate the validity claims of economics, to contrast and possibly relate those to their own, and other claims.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, most deliberative formats include — often moderated — small-group discussion, but few add to that a substantive learning component.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>Among those that do are the small-n Danish-developed Consensus Conferences <span class="citation">(Grundahl <a href="#ref-Grundahl1995">1995</a>)</span> and especially the large-n, one-off <span acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short">ca</span> in British Columbia, Canada <span class="citation">(British Columbia Citizens’ Assembly on Electoral Reform <a href="#ref-Citizen-2004-aa">2004</a>)</span>.
Consensus Conferences have been held on very technical issues, including nanotechnology <span class="citation">(Lee Kleinman et al. <a href="#ref-LeeKleinman2007">2007</a>)</span> or genetically modified foods, and the Citizen Assembly was tasked to recommend an alternative electoral system for the province.
Much like taxation, technology policy, and especially electoral systems design also demand highly structured choices (for example, a seat allocation rule or regulation) and raises a set of abstractions (party systems or risk distributions).</p>
<p>In a Consensus Conference, 12-15 self-selected but diverse citizens discuss a technical matter of political relevance for three or more days (!) and issue a report on their discussions <span class="citation">(Lee Kleinman et al. <a href="#ref-LeeKleinman2007">2007</a>)</span>.
In preparation for the conference, participants read quite extensive background material, which they discuss during the first of several daylong sessions.
At later sessions, they (publicly) share their questions with experts and finally draft a report for the sponsoring body and/or the media.
<span class="citation">Lee Kleinman et al. (<a href="#ref-LeeKleinman2007">2007</a>)</span> report that a positive atmosphere, good organization and skillful facilitation are necessary for a successful Consensus Conference.
They also recommend that participants tell their stories, which moderators then weave into themes, to help citizens relate their experiences to expert knowledge <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-LeeKleinman2007">2007</a>, 159)</span>.</p>
<p>The <span acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short">ca</span> expanded on this model.
Over the course of a year, 160 randomly selected British Columbians read and learned about electoral systems, held public hearings, deliberated amongst themselves and, after several intermediate votes, recommended a (quite complicated) <span acronym-label="stv" acronym-form="singular+short">stv</span>-variant and drafted a report <span class="citation">(British Columbia Citizens’ Assembly on Electoral Reform <a href="#ref-Citizen-2004-aa">2004</a>)</span>.
The extensive learning phase, spanning six (!) weekends stands out among deliberative experiments.
In addition to a university-level textbook on electoral systems, Citizens received interactive lectures accompanied by small discussion groups.
An expert panel vetted the learning phase for impartiality and accuracy of information.
Participants also developed a set of shared values during the learning phase, both (procedurally) for how they wished to deliberate and (substantively) for a desirable electoral system.</p>
</div>
<div id="implementation-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Implementation</h2>
<p>The <span acronym-label="ca" acronym-form="singular+short">ca</span> provides an ideal blueprint for a deliberative forum on tax;
however, limited resources and lack of experience do not permit such a large undertaking for this project.</p>
<p>Instead, the project proposed here is a scaled-down hybrid, combining the ambitious learning phases of a Citizen Assembly, with the more intimate, small-n interaction and participant empowerment of Consensus Conferences.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<p>A small, self-selected sample of 15-24 diverse, ideally randomly-sampled, citizens will attend around 6 days of learning and deliberation spread over several weeks.
A provisional schedule is included in (p. ).</p>
<p>After introducing the format and framing the issue, deliberators are invited to tell stories about experiences with taxation, following <span class="citation">Mansbridge et al. (<a href="#ref-Mansbridge2010a">2010</a>, 67)</span>‘s recommendation:
’Stories can establish credibility, create empathy, and trigger a sense of injustice, all of which contribute directly or indirectly to justification’’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Mansbridge2010a">2010</a>, 67)</span>.
Deliberators also share opinions and grievances about tax as well as identify relevant questions and issues, which will be taken up in, and structure the later learning phases.
During these learning sessions, taking up less than half of the time, participants receive information about the structured choices and relevant abstractions of taxation from the author.
These lessons are organized around themes and values identified by deliberators in an initial session, and attempt to relate the subject matter to participant experiences.
Learning sessions alternate with extensive small-group deliberations, during which participants reflect on the lessons, relate or contrast it to their own experiences and claims and adjudicate the validity of the presented moral and causal arguments.
Small-group deliberations are facilitated by a trained moderator, who has no expertise in taxation or economics.
At the end of the process, participants must agree on a tax and write a report outlining their recommendation, which can be released to the public.
If resources permit, participants will also hear a panel of expert witnesses to discuss their questions.</p>
<!---
moderator call:

The [CiviCon Citizen Conference](http://www.civicon.de) will provide moderated group discussions and other facilitation to the 15 citizen participants.

At this point, we are still looking for two (2) trained moderators/facilitators.

If you're interested, you should write to [`maximilian.held83@gmail.com`](mailto:maximilian.held.83@gmail.com) and suggest a date and time for a videoconference on this [Doodle](https://doodle.com/maxheld).


## Basics

- Date: 11.-17.08.2014, maybe plus 1 day each for preparation and review.
- Location: Syke (near Bremen), Germany
- Compensation: EUR 1000/moderator, plus travel expenses and included room/board (shared rooms)
- Student moderators are welcome, but should have some formal education in the field and practical experience and be comfortable with interacting with various people of different ages, backgrounds and political leaning.
- Some technical expertise/affinity (GitHub, Markdown) would be beneficial, but is not required.


## Format

- CiviCon is a participatory format, but with a utopian-Habermasian bent: it strives to live up to a ** *deliberative* standard of democracy**, where legitimacy comes from exchanging arguments, not (just) voting.
 The CiviCon Citizen Conference on taxation is loosely modelled on scandinavian citizen conferences and especially the [BC Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens'_Assembly_on_Electoral_Reform_(British_Columbia)).
 This raises a couple of **requirements** for the facilitation:
  - Every *argument*, or position, that participants might take has to be heard, and taken on their own merits.
  - Not only broad participation matters, but the *kind* of speech and exchange matters, too – ideally centered around trying to find common reason.
  - Facilitation must make sure that the premium on rational arguments does not disempower those citizens who might express themselves differently.
- In addition, taxation as a topic introduces its own sets  of demands:
  - The topic is fixed: taxation, but there should still be (some) room for those who might be opposed to the very institution (for various reasons).
  - Tax offers quite well-structured (constrained) choices; citizen participants are tasked to discuss the *base* and *schedule* of an ideal tax system, and, if possible, agree on one.
  - Because tax is a quite a complicated and demanding issue, there will be "learning phases" (as in the BC Citizens' Assembly), making up about 1/3 of the time, organised by Max Held (the investigator).
    The substance of these learning phases must be brought to bear on the concerns and questions citizens might bring, *and vice versa*.
- Because this is (also) a research project, formal group proceedings (but not private talk) must be taped.
  This may initially disrupt the deliberation.
- CiviCon has no mandate.
- Towards the end of the conference, there will be a press conference, at which citizen participants report on their work to the media, politicans and wider public.

Other than these requirements, the format is relatively open and should be adapted to the experience and tastes of the moderators.

    %K369: table with raw/refined opinion, and different kinds of sampling.
    %K438: ``The idea is that if a counterfactual situation is morally relevant, why not do a serious social science experiment -- rather than merely engage in informal inference or armchair empiricism -- to determine what the appropriate counterfactual situation might look like?
%and if that counterfactual is both discoverable and normatively relevent, why not then let the rest of the world know about it?
%Just as John Rawls's original position can be thought of having a kind of recommending force, the counterfactual representation of public opinion identified by the \gls{dp} also recommends to the rest of the population some conclusions that they ought to take seriously.''
    %K390: self-selected samples will be very limited in what they can achieve.
    %K401: citizen juries use quota samples, consensus conferences use self-selected samples, then with some quota sampling
    %K550: notes that positions must not merely be balanced in terms of airtime or affect, but ``whether the considerations offered in favor of, or against, a proposal, candidate or policy are answered in a substantive way by those who advocate a different position.'' %THIS IS KEY!
    %K561: three categories for such considerations
        %``the benefits or burdens of a policy or political choice,
        % the causal arguments about whether those benefits or benefits or burdens will actually result from one choice or another,
        %and the values by which those benefits and burdens might best be evaluated.''
        %K1424: ``the problem is that any microcosmis deliberation taking place in a modern society will be one in which there are significant social and economic inequalities in the conduct of ordinary life in the broader society.
            %It seems difficult or impossible to `bracket' these inequalities -- for participants to behave `as if' they do not exist.
            %Indeed the problem goes deeper.
%The possibility of doing so is the challenge of the ``autonomy of the political'', namely, whether or not equality can hold sway in politics in a world in which inequality rules in economic and social relations.
            %The viability and legitimacy of the liberal-democratic process may turn on the answer.'' \citep[loc.
%2679]{Fishkin2009}

%iris marion young, especially notes that people of lower status may have a hard time getting listened to, or that others may be particularly accustomed to orderly forms of reason-giving arguments that weigh with other participants -- and this may be particulary problematic the more substantive the topic is.

<!-- absolutely must re-read moore piece on conducting deliberation; this is key for how it's done and facilitated, there are also helpful comments in there. -->
<!-- this will definetely remain very much a proof of concept; it's too small and unporfessionall to say much -->
<!-- - Meaningfully deliberating tax requires a lot of knowledge, and that knowledge is unlikely to spring merely from the act of deliberation, but it needs some input. -->
<p>This will produce (small-n) data, that may not lend itself to a conventional quantitative DP-research design (essentially a within-subjects Likert-type data).
A small sample may not be statistically powerful enough to produce significant effects.
Instead the same quasi-experimental design could be run with qualitative data, including, open-ended questionnaires and/or semi-structured interviews, or even a record of the deliberations.
Such data could be content-analysed (or rather: coded) to distill the (mis)understanding before and after the treatment.</p>

- 5-7 days (depending on funding)
- face-to-face, all-day including common lodging and meals
- Includes learning phases, expert panels and small group / plenary deliberation, modelled roughly on the Citizen Assembly (electoral reform in Britsh Columbia)
- Deliberators are briefed with an extensive issue book, material is reviewed during the deliberation.
- Issue book and learning phases are “vetted” by a diverse panel of economists (e.g. Hickel, Traub, Sauernheimer, Frank)
- Learning phases are held by Max Held, organized along questions from draft chapters on tax and mixed economy, reframed for maximum accessibility.
    Learning phases are interrupted by moderated, small-group sessions, in which deliberators reflect on what they have learned and relate it to personal experience, judgements and understandings.
    Crosby et al. stress face-to-face, extended interviews of expert witnesses, rather than written issue books or presentations (\cite[loc. 1899]{CrosbyNethercut-2005-aa}
    Carson & Hartz-Karp recommend panels of stakeholders, instead -- I'd rather go with scientists, because stakeholders (political parties etc.) are way too deep in this game already, and may fail to ask the deepest, most relevant questions about tax.
- Deliberation phases are held (in plenary and small groups) by 2-3 trained moderators.
    Moderators guide the discussion and encourage an agenda of questions, but are not experts in the field.
    Max Held does not participate in the deliberation phases.
    (Supposed expertise must not silence debate or dissent).
    People with experience in teaching, intercultural communication or community organising might make good moderators (e.g. Anja Jungermann).
- The sample is *not* representative, but seeks to maximize diverse backgrounds, experiences and preferences.
    It’s a *saturation* / stratified ranom sample. Details
    - A random sample is drawn and invited to “apply”.
        If no random sample can be drawn (expensive), a random geographic walk of households and within-household randomization might do.
        People are asked to provide some SES-data.
    - From the (self-selected!) applicants, a saturation sample of 8-16 or so people is constructed, who are invited to participate.
- Set-up:
    - People from around Bremen (to reduce travel cost) are lodged together.
    - Meals are prepared together both to forge understanding, and to reduce cost.
        Citizens can suggest recipes, staff will provide ingredients.
    - Sessions are held in office rooms available at Jacobs University or Uni Bremen.
    - No or only a small (50-100 EUR) honorarium is granted, but all costs (including local travel) are covered.
        On-site child-care is offered.

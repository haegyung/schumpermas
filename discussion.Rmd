# Discussion

<!-- - how do the results relate to the posed research question? -->
<!--    - what are possible issues of *validity, reliability* (both in terms of the theoretical demands of q, and the theoretical demands of the deliberative "treatment")? -->
<!--    - how does this add to the literature on the *subjectivity on taxation*? (fka as "misunderstandings") -->
<!--    - how does this add to the literature on *empirical effects of deliberation*? -->
<!--    - how does this add to the *canon of q-studies*? -->


<!-- it's actually a little iffy that inequality (though materially represented!) wasn't really discussed.
instead, people got around this by kinda blaming the state
or maybe not, maybe they were really just polite or properly abstract, and trying to avoid making redistribution into a weird, one-off thing, discretionary -->

# Discussion

<!-- - how do the results relate to the posed research question? -->
<!--    - what are possible issues of *validity, reliability* (both in terms of the theoretical demands of q, and the theoretical demands of the deliberative "treatment")? -->
<!--    - how does this add to the literature on the *subjectivity on taxation*? (fka as "misunderstandings") -->
<!--    - how does this add to the literature on *empirical effects of deliberation*? -->
<!--    - how does this add to the *canon of q-studies*? -->

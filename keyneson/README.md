This is just a *submodule* to the *supermodule* [`keyneson`](https://github.com/maxheld83/keyneson), to simplify independent version tracking.

For docs, context, issues, etc. please go to [`keyneson`](https://github.com/maxheld83/keyneson).

Please also note that the contents of this submodule make sense **only in relation to specific versions of other sub- and supermodules**.
These necessary pointers to versions of other modules are included both in the releases on this repo, as well as in the supermodule [`keyneson`](https://github.com/maxheld83/keyneson).

In other words: Please move on, nothing to watch here.

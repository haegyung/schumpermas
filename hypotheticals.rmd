# Well-Structured Hypotheticals {#hypotheticals}

<!-- these are first order hypotheticals -->

<!-- this is what the learning phases are about -->

<!-- taxes vs fees vs pigou (tijnbergen!) -->

<!-- find higher equilibria -->

<!-- if there were no other taxes, no fundamental alternatives, no deep disagreement -- then why should we bother for deliberation?
in that case, we might just stick with the status quo, or maybe move on to fix the small stuff, or the really big stuff (capitalism)
in this case, we can really move on from tax -->

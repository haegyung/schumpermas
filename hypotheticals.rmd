# Well-Structured Hypotheticals {#hypotheticals}

> *"One should always look for a possible alternative, and provide against it.
> It is the first rule of criminal investigation."*\
> --- Sherlock Holmes in Conan @Doyle1904's *The Adventure of Black Peter* [-@Doyle1904 567]

In this crime story of the welfare state, tax and democracy, I follow Holmes' advise and attempt to rule out all possible alternatives.
The first alternative to be ruled out is --- counter-intuitively --- that, in Margaret Thatcher's words, *there is no alternative*.
Before a criminal investigation of a corpse can begin in earnest, detectives have to show that it was not, in fact, a natural death.
Put another way, they must demonstrate that the deceased person *might* have lived on, had not someone or something intervened.

To proceed by the method of elimination is always to conceive of such hypothetical outcomes, and then, to falsify them.
Still, hypotheticals
[^1]
are rarely invoked in social scientific explanations:
ever hear of an empirical sociologist or political scientist comparing the continental welfare state [@Esping-Andersen-1990-aa] or Westminster democracy [@Lijphart-1999-aa] to a *non-existent* alternative?
We can see why few empirical social scientists would ask such a question:
to say that taxation could be more efficient and equitable, and to suspect that someone (for example, the rich) or something (for example, capitalism) is preventing it from being so reeks off conspiracy theory.

Forensics, in some ways, has it easier:
if a coroner diagnoses heart failure from old age as the cause of death, there is no murder.
If the autopsy reveals a coronary artery ruptured by a bullet, natural death is out of the question.

Just *which* social ills are unavoidable and thereby the social scientific equivalents to a natural death is, unfortunately, more contentious.
Plausibly, without the bullet, an otherwise healthy person might have lived to see another day, but writ on a societal level, such hypothesizing about alternative, preferable outcomes is hard.
Would democracy *not* always fall short of its ancient ideal, because we can no longer all meet and debate in person?
Would taxation *not* always be wasteful, because it suppresses otherwise pareto-improving exchanges?
Would welfare *not* always be a drag on growth, because it dampens incentives?

Empiricism

:   \phantomsection
    [\[itm:empiricism\]]{#itm:empiricism label="itm:empiricism"}
    *"We cannot know"*, might reply the empiricist [@Bacon1620; @Locke1689; @Hume1739] because such hypotheticals can, by definition, not be experienced with our senses and nothing can be induced from them.

    Whatever democracy, taxation and welfare *could be*, we cannot know.

    Similarly, positivists might find these hypotheticals unknowable, either because absent, they *have been* falsified [@Comte1842; @Durkheim1895], or, because absent, they *cannot* be falsified [@Popper1934].

Idealism

:   \phantomsection
    [\[itm:idealism\]]{#itm:idealism label="itm:idealism"}
    *"We know only through ideas"*, might respond the idealists [broadly @Kant1781; @Hegel1807], including the ideas invoked in these questions.

    Whatever democracy, taxation and welfare *could be*, is beside the point, because our knowledge of them exists independent from their factual or hypothetical reality.

    Specifically, interpretive sociologists [@Weber1897] might argue that the above questions may contain in them already one of several, cultural perspectives, ideas or terminologies in which all answers, too, would be have to be phrased.
    "Waste", "growth" and 'incentives'' rather than objective things, already are cultural reality [compare @Beland2010].

Constructivism

:   \phantomsection
    [\[itm:constructivism\]]{#itm:constructivism label="itm:constructivism"}
    *"Asks *who*?"*, might retort the constructivist [@Berger1966; @Paul1984], because these are not questions about an objectively knowable world, but rather, the act of asking these questions and of invoking these concepts *makes* that social world.

    Whatever democracy, taxation and welfare *could be*, is beside the point, too, because legitimacy, efficiency, equity --- or any other criteria --- *become* real, as we think, demand and reject them.

Rationalism

:   \phantomsection
    [\[itm:rationalism\]]{#itm:rationalism label="itm:rationalism"}
    *"We can know"*, might announce the rationalists [@Descartes1637; @Spinoza1662; @Leibniz1704] --- *"but hypothetical or actuality do not matter, either way"*.

    Whatever democracy, taxation and welfare *could be*, we can know by deductive reasoning, without relying on our experience --- or absence thereof.

Clearly, *none* of these epistemologies (or ontologies?) taken to the extreme, can help investigate those desirable, and doable hypotheticals upon which I have stumbled.
Welfare, taxation and democracy certainly are ideas, but they are also bound by empirics.
They are accessible to deductive reasoning, but such reasoning can make a social world, as much as it seeks to explain it.
What I need, is a (p. ).

Equally clearly, such a cartoonish overview of epistemological traditions does not suffice to ground this dissertation.
Fortunately, this is --- as promised --- a pedestrian thesis and I will not abscond into any philosophy of science.
Unfortunately, I am also largely ignorant of these theories of knowledge, and can only provide a provisional epistemology that seems to work for democracy, taxation and welfare.

I take no pride in my epistemological ignorance, but I am weary of the obliviousness of these, and other meta-(meta?)-concerns.
In a slightly different context, Noam @Chomsky1997 has observed that "ontological questions are generally beside the point, hardly more than a form of harassment" [-@Chomsky1997 132].
As harassments go, I have found that such epistemological and ontological debates often arouse what would appear to be deeply-felt passions in even the drowsiest of graduate seminars.
This fervor always struck me as eerily performative [compare @Goffman1959; @Butler1997], as if, in addition to --- or as *part of*
[^2]
--- *doing gender* [@West1987], we were also *doing social science*.

If only to stick to my limited last, I prefer a social science that serves people other than its researchers, and accordingly sympathize with pragmatist epistemologies, where human problems are primary and reified "philosophical fallacies" [@Dewey1929] take a back seat to the problems they were invented to solve.
In @Wikipedia2013's apt description of an (ecologically) pragmatist epistemology:
"inquiry is how organisms can get a grip on their environment\" (retrieved in March 2013).

Even though, because hypotheticals are hardly invoked in the social sciences, are hard to specify, and are harder to know about I must devote this chapter to explicating the (p. ), (p. ) and (p. ) of my research.


## The Epistemology of Hypotheticals {#sec:epistemology}

[^3]

> *"If they can get you asking the wrong questions, they don't have to worry about the answers."*\
> --- Thomas R. Pynchon (\*1937)

Detective shows often confine the forensic medicine to some expository dialogue between coroner and inspector at the morgue.
I need a little more exposition here, stretching over several chapters of welfare economics, normative political theory and public choice, before the empirical action even begins.
Again, I merely proceed by the method of elimination.
To open an investigation, I must first know if there are alternative welfare states, taxes, and democracies out there, and if so, what they are.

Surely, to suggest that we might learn something about the world by asking what is *not* appears to be an odd epistemology.
Natural scientists probably do not spend much time thinking up, say, a counterfactual universe without gravity, and explaining why it is not (or maybe that *is* what they do at the Large Hadron Collider?!).
Positive social science, at least, needs to pose these why-not-questions, because, unlike physics, it is concerned with *who* or *what* made the world the way it *is*.
[^4]

Positive sociology, political science, and this dissertation, all ask such second-order questions.
Even to pose them, we need all the possible first-order answers of how the world *could* be, but is not.
The hypotheticals I establish in the following chapters are these first-order *non*-answers.

### First-Order Questions {#sec:1st-questions}

Hypotheticals must be (p. ), and --- if you allow some humanist bias --- they must also be at least somewhat (p. ).
Those criteria both raise inquiries of the first order, asking what is normatively good and what is positively possible, respectively.

<!-- % ``A great deal of work on deliberative theory focuses on conflicting values, religious toleration, identities and so on, and relatively little on conflicting facts.'' \cite[2]{Moore2011} -->

*Normative* (or prescriptive) social science asks such first-order questions as how to emancipate people (critical theory, maybe from @Gramsci1971 to @Adorno-1974-aa, Horkheimer and @Habermas-1984), what makes rule legitimate (political theory from @Aristoteles to @Dahl-1989-aa) or what allocation might be fair (distributive justice including @Friedman1962 and @Rawls1986) and even what makes an economy rich (economics from @Smith-1776-lq to @Hicks1939).
Even these apparently normative and first-order questions turn into positive and second-order questions when their underlying assumptions on human nature are tested or problematized, respectively (more on that twist on p. ).

*Positive* social science asks few, if any, first-order questions, because as it asks about the social world (for example, health insurance), it seeks to explain the social conflict of *answering* a first-order question (for example, how to spread risk).
To the extent that nominally *social* sciences have carved out positive research agendas of the first order (for example, cognitive psychology, behavioral economics), they cease to be social science but revert to a natural science of some ideally *physically* rooted phenomenon (for example, neuroscience).
Tautologically, if the social sciences are to be concerned with explaining social choice, they know *no* positive first-order questions, because first-order status negates choice.
[^5]

The aspects of the social world under study here are welfare, taxation and democracy.
To the extent that these social choices hinge on last reasons, they raise normative first-order questions.
These first-order questions of efficiency and equity, fairness and legitimacy have been widely discussed, and I will reference them only briefly in this dissertation.

But welfare, taxation and democracy also raise two kinds of positive questions:
[^6]

A Priori Knowledge

:   \phantomsection
    [\[itm:a-priori\]]{#itm:a-priori label="itm:a-priori"}
    There may only be finite or even unique ways to organize these institutions that abide by *formal logic*, per reasoned, *a priori knowledge*.

    For example, a welfare state financed solely by printing money may be an economically illogical institution (possibly resulting hyperinflation resembles a pyramid scheme).
    Similarly, taxing judicial persons, such as corporations, may be economically nonsensical because such organizations are no moral subjects and the incidence would be arbitrary ().
    As a last example, a democratic aggregation mechanism may not be able to maximize both majority rule and proportional representation, simply because the two criteria conflict.

    Knowledge about what is logically possible or impossible flows from a epistemology (p. ).

A Posteriori Knowledge

:   \phantomsection
    [\[itm:a-posteriori\]]{#itm:a-posteriori label="itm:a-posteriori"}
    These formally logical designs may be further limited by empirical, first-order findings on human nature or other material conditions, per experiential, *a posteriori* knowledge.

    For example, a welfare state financed by extracting and burning fossil fuels may soon run into physical constraints if we observe limited resources and related global warming.
    Similarly, a fully-planned economy (instead of taxation) may, amongst other things, dramatically overestimate the cognitive ability of human planners to centrally aggregate and process dispersed information.
    Lastly, a democracy modeled on ancient Athens, but with universal suffrage and in globally integrated economies may fail simply because human beings interact too slowly to listen to every fellow human on the planet, let alone to get anything done.
    [^7]

    Knowledge about what is empirically possible or impossible flows from an epistemology (p. ).

These are, admittedly, uncontroversial constraints and ludicrous suggestions --- I want to keep the more interesting problems for later --- but they illustrate an important point:
there probably *are* some first-order, positive limits the social world faces, even though we may know little and disagree a lot about them.

Crucially, we may disagree on whether a given question is of the first or second order.
The social sciences, in particular, have a habit of reassigning first-order questions to second-order status:
*that* is the project of constructivism [for example, @Berger1966] and (p. ) to see social phenomena not as "things *in* the world, but perspectives *on* the world" [@Brubaker-2002-aa 174 on ethnicity, emphasis in the original] or as contested and consequential second-order *answers*.
Still, even a die-hard idealist or constructivist may concede some irreducibly positive, first-order questions, and to those, the social sciences offer no answers.

So it is with welfare, taxation and democracy.
Their design probably faces some --- albeit uncertain and contested --- positive limits of the first order.
To ask about these limits is, emphatically, *not* a question for the social sciences.
Instead, *nominally* social scientific, but formally mathematical-logical disciplines such as equilibrium economics
[^8]
and public choice ask about the internal consistency
of such societal institutions, based on assumptions on (p. ), which are in turn hypothesized and falsified by such natural sciences as evolutionary psychology (a.k.a. sociobiology), social psychology [initially @KahnemanTversky1979], cognitive science, or even physics.
I suggest two examples of such first-order, positive substrates relevant to my subject matter:

1.  The first theorem of welfare economics is often invoked as a first-order constraint on welfare state interventions or taxation (the [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"}), and it also shines through in some radical defenses of pluralist democracy [for example, @Caplan2007].
    The theorem states that over any *given* distribution, free competition equilibrates at pareto optimality
    [^9]
    and that therefore, no allocative intervention can make anyone better off without making someone else worse off.
    It is a mathematically formulated argument about some internal consistency of the market mechanism:
    given certain (p. ), market equilibria *cannot* be pareto-improved.

    As such, the theorem is just that, an exercise in formal logic, not more:
    not empirical claim (no "proof" that *actual* markets pareto-optimize) and not normative statement (no justification for pareto-optimization over existing distributions as desirable).
    But the first theorem is also not less:
    properly understood, it *is* a first-order constraint and invites *no* second-order critique.

2.  Similarly, homo economicus is often invoked in the field of welfare (*"knaves"* as in @LeGrand2003), taxation (*"people react to incentives"* as in @Mankiw-2004-aa [24]) and democracy (*"rationally irrational"* as in @Caplan2007).
    The concept implies that human beings make rational, self-interested and utility-maximizing decisions (maybe first @Mill1848, @Smith-1776-lq, recently including @Robbins1976 on rational choice, all summarized in @Persky1995).
    The ideological campaign (and backlash) wrought by homo economicus and its offspring notwithstanding, it is, properly understood, merely a *falsifiable*
    [^10]
    assumption about human nature that welfare, taxation and democracy might have to heed if it were, in fact, correct.
    But even if it were true, homo economicus would be just that, an empirically verified model:
    no more (no normative claim of how we *should* be), but also no less (no socially contingent phenomenon in need of deconstruction).


    Second-Order Questions {#sec:2nd-questions}
    ----------------------

    As forensics informs a criminal investigation, the first-order answers provide the reference for the second order inquiries.
    These ask who or what decides first-order answers, or, metaphorically, who or what brought about the observed forensic outcome (see , p. ).
    Second-order inquiries seek to criticize, explain or test the *social conflict* over first-order questions.

    Social science asks plenty of those questions on welfare, taxation and democracy.

    It asks, for example, why and how welfare states --- a first-order *answer* --- evolve(d):
    because modernization replaced inherited, familial status with citizenship and the market [@Titmuss1974; @Marshall-1950-aa], because industrialization required an appeased, reliable and healthy workforce [@Flora1981; @Wilensky1975], because workers gained power [@Korpi1983; @Jessop2002], because institutions prevail [for example, @Rothstein], because ideas matter [for example, @Stiller2009] because initial class cleavages lead to different degrees of commodification [@Esping-Andersen-1990-aa] or because capitalism comes in variants [@HallSoskice-2001-aa].
    [^11]

    So it is with the second-order theories of taxation:
    it arose as proto-states extracted the resources enabled by, and necessary for greater economies of scale in their state-making and war-making [@Tilly-1985-aa], it (sometimes) erodes to lower levels as internationally mobile factors of production and consumption arbitrage over different national rates (recently reviewed in @Genschel2010), it persists at similar levels as domestic politics prevents roll-back [@Swank2002], or it changes bases and schedule in response to these pressures [@Kemmerling2009].
    <!-- %need more general literature here, not this contentious one-sided stuff, maybe more from the fiscal sociology stuff. -->

    And so, too, it is with the second-order theory of pluralist democracy:
    states introduced popular rule, because the costs of otherwise considered illegitimate extraction became prohibitive [@Tilly2006], democracy belongs to a broader syndrome of emancipating modernization, including a market economy and corresponding rational and self-expression values [@InglehartWelzel-2005-aa] or the sequential development of citizenship (instead of other, pre-modern statuses) entailed democratic rights [@Marshall-1950-aa].
    <!-- %need more general literature here -->

    These are variations on the questions of sociology:
    what binds us together (social integration), and what keeps us apart (social inequality).
    [^12]
    These are also the questions of political science:
    how do power, norms, ideas and institutions rule human interactions?
    These second-order questions are open to all epistemologies, including the the anti-positivist traditions of and .
    They can also be --- as seems to be currently en vogue
    [^13]
    ---, *but need not be*, entirely or, inquiries.

    And important questions, they are, asking us, that lone "hypercultural" species [@Henrich2004], how we make our own history.
    In our rich time and in our unequal place, welfare, taxation and democracy may just be *the* historical battlegrounds, on which these sociological and political forces operate.

    This dissertation develops a second-order theory of social change to explain the defeats these institutions have suffered in late capitalism, and tests it empirically.
    [^14]

    \centering
    ![image](orders-of-questions){width="1\linewidth"}

    The distinction between first-, second-order, normative and positive questions summarized in (p. ) matters for at least two reasons:

    1.  Clearly addressing one of these questions at a time, and striving to keep them separate makes for better social science.
        With these categorically different questions come different goals, languages and methods.
        With blurring or negating these categories come "politics-based evidence making" (The Economist 2012), apolitical ignorance or both.

    2.  Because positive social science --- including this dissertation --- is out to explain the second-order decision on first-order questions, it must consider some first-order theory *first*.

    First Order Theory *First* {#sec:1st-questions-first}
    --------------------------

    I am ultimately interested in the second-order questions of welfare, taxation and democracy, but proceeding by the method of elimination, I must first ask and answer the first-order questions:
    what *should* and *could* welfare, taxation and democracy look like.

    Consider the two alternatives, that I must rule out before any second-order questions can be raised:

    No Desirable Hypothetical.

    :   If I could find only the presently observed design of welfare, tax and democracy to be at least somewhat desirable, there would be no social conflict to be explained, much like there is no need for a political science of wearing sunscreen.
        (I partly take this , p. ).

        In the crime story metaphor, if the corpse in question had previously run amok shooting innocents, rupturing that persons coronary artery with a bullet might be have been self-defense or the last resort, and the only desirable course of action.
        No *further* criminal investigation may be necessary.

    No Doable Hypothetical.

    :   If I could find only the presently observed design of tax and democracy to be materially doable, there would be no social conflict to be explained, much like there is no need for a sociological theory of gravity.

        In the crime story metaphor, if said deceased suffered from an irreparable birth defect that caused the heart failure, no outcome but death is materially possible.
        In that case, too, no criminal investigation will be necessary.
        <!-- %add table here to further explain these.
        %crosstab it. -->

    Conceiving such to-be-ruled-out hypotheticals raises normative (desirability) and positive (doability) questions of the *first*-order.
    These first-order questions cannot, as I explained above, be answered by social sciences (alone), but I must instead reference other disciplines, much like a detective hears forensic evidence.

    If these ancillary disciplines reveal one, or several such desirable and doable hypotheticals that I cannot rule out, the non-occurrence of such hypothetical welfare, taxation and democracy beg a second-order explanation just as the observed arrangement requires explanation.
    In fact, the two are the same thing:
    to explain the presence of the present arrangement is to explain the absence of all absent arrangements.

    For illustration, consider the inverse scenario, in which I find no desirable and doable hypotheticals in welfare, taxation and democracy.
    If that were the case, there would be no second-order decision to be explained, because without such hypotheticals, there is no human choice.

    If however, there *are* desirable and doable hypotheticals, any second-order question always invokes these hypotheticals.

    Fallacies and Risks
    -------------------

    <!-- %better title:
    %glass full empty? -->
    To be sure, this reasoning is not logically watertight and might turn into an argument from ignorance:
    even if I find no reason why hypotheticals should, or could not be, they might still be undesirable or impossible for some other reason.
    Absence of evidence, here, too, does not constitute evidence of absence.

    The same problem must plague medical forensics:
    no evidence of natural death does not prove a violent death and any conclusion to the contrary might cause an unnecessary murder investigation.
    In practice, this possible fallacy simply raises the question of where you place the burden of proof, because you can err either way:
    if you take absence of evidence of violent death as evidence of natural death, you might foreclose a necessary investigation and let someone get away with murder.
    Tellingly, when it comes to human corpses we place the burden of proof on the status quo:
    if the cause of death cannot be established --- if there is *no* evidence of natural death --- the prosecution customarily opens an investigation.
    <!-- %find source for this -->

    The positive social science of welfare, tax and democracy seems to have adopted a somewhat laxer standard.
    Here, much empirical work implicitly places the burden of proof on the hypothetical:
    without evidence that the hypothetical is normatively desirable and materially possible, the fundamental status quo of welfare and tax needs no social explanation.
    Conveniently, as hypotheticals go, they rarely produce conclusive evidence of their desirability and doability.
    Maybe, this is just the skepticism that positivism calls for --- or maybe, , and such social science invariable turns latently affirmative (, p. ).

    Either way, I here place the burden of proof on the status quo.
    If I find no reasons to the contrary, I assume that there *are* several doable and desirable designs of tax and democracy, and require social science to explain the *absence* of all but the presently observed design.
    If we apply the standard of forensics, any second-order theory of social change must be able to explain how the social conflict under study resulted in the non-occurrence of these alternative designs, especially the attractive ones.

    I still want to shoulder part of the burden of proof.
    In tax, I can only plausibilize the hypotheticals by reviewing reputable work by others, and deduce my case from reasonable assumptions about human nature, and the economy.
    I must rely mostly on a epistemology (p. ).
    Natural experiments --- the gold standard --- are unavailable, and all others suffer from limited external validity:
    a modern economy does not fit in the laboratory and equilibrium simulations poorly model such inframarginal institutional changes.
    <!-- %more on this somewhere else.
    %Should explain why I can't look into tax in another way! Reference this section here. -->
    In democracy, I similarly plausibilize the hypotheticals, but I can also point to and undertake some preliminary experimental tests.

    To suggest, as I do, that there are desirable and doable hypotheticals in tax and democracy, must remain a preliminary proposition open to falsification.
    To the @Popper1934ian scientist, there is always some absence of evidence, and therefore, no evidence of absence.
    If these particular hypotheticals turn out to be undesirable or impossible, so collapses any second-order hypothesis I might wager later, but, I hope, we will still have learned something.

    Not only the advancement of science depends on such falsification, the history of progressive causes is also littered with what might charitably be called "false positives".
    My chosen hypotheticals --- deliberative democracy and progressive taxation of (unimproved) land value and (postpaid) consumption, too, may inspire such false hopes.
    They, too, should be approached with great care, especially, when they necessitate constitutional or otherwise reform of liberal democracy, as deliberative democracy may one day do.
    Tax reform, at least, should be open to falsification and is not an end in itself, especially because it thoroughly hinges on economic contexts and human motivation.

    Then again, by any historical standard --- once-hypotheticals failed (for example, socialism) and successful (for example, universal suffrage) alike --- here are some fairly incremental reforms as carefully liberal in their (p. ) as they are conservative about (p. ).

    Axioms for Desirable Hypotheticals {#sec:axiology}
    ==================================
    <!-- %or last reasons? -->

    > *"I believe in clear-cut positions.
    > I think that the most arrogant position is this apparent, multidisciplinary modesty of *'what I am saying now is not unconditional, it is just a hypothesis,'* and so on.
    > \[...\]
    > I think that the only way to be honest and expose yourself to criticism is to state clearly and dogmatically where you are.
    > You must take the risk and have a position."*\
    > --- Slavov @Zizek2003 [45]

    Normatively desirable hypotheticals are preferable to others if we assume a basic humanist, or critical intention of positive social science and policy analysis to improve human lives.

    From a strictly positivist point of view, this is the flimsiest of epistemological decisions I take:
    we might learn just as much about the social world from the nonoccurrence of bad outcomes, as from the nonoccurence of good outcomes.
    [^15]

    My bias for desirable hypotheticals might be epistemologically arbitrary, but it is --- again --- pragmatic:
    there may just be so many undesirable, but doable counterfactuals (why *not* return to workhouses rather than welfare, tariffs rather than taxation and mob rule rather than liberal democracy?) that it becomes plainly easier to pick amongst the supposedly fewer, attractive hypotheticals.
    Moreover --- if mostly implicitly --- modernization theory, (structural) functionalism and related traditions might have convincingly explained away some of those graver regresses of civilization.
    Lastly --- only slightly tongue-in-cheek ---, on a second look at the factual horror chamber of welfare, tax and democracy, there might not be *that* many even less desirable, doable hypotheticals left.

    What then, makes for desirable hypotheticals?

    Emphatically, hypothetical tax, welfare and democracy, and with them, this research, hinge on last reasons.
    Desirable tax and welfare are rational, efficient and fair.
    Democracy, too, must be these things and more:
    emancipatory, equal and deliberative.

    Unfortunately, these last reasons sometimes conflict, and they do not even flow from any single ethic.
    What makes my hypothetical tax, welfare and democracy desirable is, instead, a hodgepodge of mongrels from quite distinct normative theories.
    I here list five of them and show how they apply to taxation, welfare and democracy:

    Virtue Ethics [\[itm:virtue\]]{#itm:virtue label="itm:virtue"}

    :   Tax, welfare and democracy are not desirably merely to the extent that they constitute, or foster *virtue* inherent to human action and character (from @Aristotelesa, @Plato, @St.ThomasAcquinas1274 to @schwartz2006practical).
        At least under neoclassical dictum, tax and welfare are desirable to the extent that they *do not* depend on, nor improve human virtue, but efficiently orchestrate our selfish demons [compare @Smith-1776-lq].
        Liberal democracy, similarly, is desirable to the extent that it sidesteps questions of personal virtue and guarantees an agnostic process for all people, no matter the quality of their character [compare @Dahl-1989-aa].

        And yet, I rely on virtue ethics when I praise markets and states for letting us reap (p. ), that supposed destiny of our nature [for example, @Wright2000].
        The case for deliberative democracy, too --- as all virtue ethics --- implies a *telos* of human life, to the extent that it posits intersubjective understanding or *communicative action* as a last reason [@Habermas-1984].

    Consequentialism [\[itm:consequentialism\]]{#itm:consequentialism label="itm:consequentialism"}

    :   Tax, welfare and democracy are also not desirable merely by the outcomes they produce, be they utility [@Bentham1789; @Mill1863] or even self-interest [@Rand1957].
        Attractive consequences, especially different aggregate functions of utility
        [^16]
        go a long way to justifying taxation and welfare, but I would not bet the farm on them.
        Even if, say, relative inequality were empirically unrelated to "subjective happiness" (as @KalmijnVeenhoven-2005-aa seem to imply),

        and progressive taxation therefore not a maximizer of aggregate happiness, at least two other reasons would remain:

        1.  Straightforwardly, we might wish to maximize consequences *other* than some measure of hedonistic gain, including equality, growth, knowledge or liberty.

            Utilitarianism --- as other consequentialisms --- side-step entirely the question of how the desired consequences would be measured, and who would do the observing.
            [^17]
            Utilitarianism merely posits an *ideal observer* [@Rawls1988] --- such as @Veenhoven-2000-aa's subjective happiness --- and does not allow us to problematize the conditions under which consequences are enumerated, or measured.
            [^18]

        2.  More fundamentally, progressive taxation --- or some other policy --- may remain attractive not because of *any* distribution or measurement of consequence, but because equality might be inherently *virtuous*, or the goods it can buy (including universal health care) may be a matter of *deontological* rights.

        The consequentialist case for democracy is even thinner:
        as @Dahl-1989-aa [176] reminds us, equal intrinsic worth of humans *alone* might be achieved by a benevolent dictator.
        Only in conjunction with (deontological? virtuous?) personal autonomy does it require democratic rule.

        And yet, hypotheticals about taxation and welfare, and even democracy cannot ignore consequences, especially (p. ) and its (p. ).

    Deontological Ethics

    :   \phantomsection
        [\[itm:deontological\]]{#itm:deontological label="itm:deontological"}
        Tax, welfare and democracy are also not merely desirable to the extend that they abide by some set of absolute rights and duties.

        On the one hand, most such deontological ethics are not specific enough to inform choices of tax, welfare and democracy.
        For instance, the Golden Rule --- *do unto others as you would have done to yourself* --- may not tell us much about what we should tax, when we should intervene in the market or how we should count votes.
        @Kant1781's similar categorical imperative is equally mum on these matters, maybe because his is a philosophy and
        deals with *man* in the singular, not *men* in the plural as @Arendt1958 demanded of political theory.
        [^19]
        Natural rights theories (from @Grotius1625), be they liberal (from @Locke1689a to maybe @Rawls-1993-aa), spinoff (right-)libertarian (diverse, prominently @Hayek1944, @Nozick1974) concerned with negative freedoms *from* (for example, false imprisonment), or positive freedoms *to* (for example, human dignity, both @Berlin1969) provide more guidelines, but they, too, are limited.
        Natural rights theories, and especially liberalism, set outer limits on what a government or person must not do *to*, or must not fail to do *for* the bearers of these rights, but they are too digital for a normative ethic of welfare, taxation and democracy.
        For example, market interventions may be either permissible (freedom-to) or illegitimate (right-libertarianism), but natural rights do not offer much qualifications in-between.
        It is of course the great appeal of natural rights that they are unconditional (as in *"Human dignity shall be inviolable"*, German Basic Law 1948) and pre-social (as in *"...that all men are created equal"*, US Declaration of Independence 1776), but that makes them a little too lofty for inherently social, and contingent institutions as welfare and taxation.
        There may, for example, be many (or no) taxes that allow for *life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness* (*ibid.*), but it would be a stretch to argue that these natural rights are best respected or least harmed by any particular tax on consumption, income or wealth.
        Crucially, too, many collective decisions in late capitalism must balance one persons liberty, against another persons pursuit of happiness, or similar rival natural rights.

        Contract theories (from @Hobbes-1651-aa, @Rousseau1762 to @Rawls-1971) are more specific still, by prescribing a decision-making process or condition to balance and protect rival rights.
        While this may suffice to specify a desirable democracy (authoritatively @Dahl-1989-aa on *liberal*, *pluralist* poliarchy), contract theories still recede into procedural norms on taxation and welfare.
        @Dahl-1989-aa --- but not @Rawls-1971, as we shall see! --- may inform us about how we should decide between, say, an income or a consumption tax, but abstains from substantive judgement.
        When, however, the very quality of the (second-order) decision process over these tax choices is in question --- as it is in this dissertation --- evaluating first-order hypotheticals by a procedural standard risks infinite regress:
        a tax is good if the process was good, and the process is good if the tax is good, which is good if ...and so on.
        <!-- %consider including the visualization about euler diagrams and production possibility frontiers in here? -->

        On the other hand, tax and welfare especially, are institutions that negotiate and trade off competing rights and duties, rather than strictly abide by them.
        Natural rights to, say, property *and* health care, offer no all-or-nothing propositions in taxation.
        Instead, one tax may encroach *less* on property than another, or at a greater (utilitarian) gain in health care than another.

        In sum, deontological ethics, and especially its popular, liberal, contractual and procedural representatives are both not specific enough, and too demanding for desirable hypotheticals in welfare, taxation and democracy.

        And yet, I cannot do without deontological ethics, especially not without liberalism.
        Even if governments *could* expropriate some owners at supposedly minimal welfare losses --- as the Eurogroup has allowed (encouraged?) the Cypriot government to proceed in 2013 with big savers --- it should not do so (nor be allowed to), because protection of confidence is a deontological right.
        Similarly, even if democratic rule found executive pay excessive, and anticipated no [dwl]{acronym-label="dwl" acronym-form="singular+short"} fallout, it should not --- as Switzerland did in 2013 --- regulate *uncoerced exchanges* [@Nozick1974] even between CEOs and shareholders, when a less intrusive policy (tax!) is available, simply because liberal states do not do that.
        <!-- %find better, thesis-related examples -->

    Ethics of Care

    :   [\[itm:ethics-of-care\]]{#itm:ethics-of-care label="itm:ethics-of-care"}
        Lastly, tax, welfare and democracy are, for the most part, *not* desirable because they establish caring relationships, as some (difference?) feminists have demanded [@Noddings1984; @Gilligan1982].
        Whether we like it or not --- in fact, we *should* like it --- our world is ruled by abstractions, too, and to these must respond our institutions of tax, welfare and democracy.
        Absent a regress to lower, poorer levels of functional differentiation --- or some yet unforeseen explosion in human capacity --- we depend on wide-ranging abstractions such as a price system to orchestrate at least some of our relationships by mutual self-interest.
        [^20]
        Ethics of care govern *individual*, *concrete* and *personal* relationships, and not those anonymously expressed in price signals, or some other abstraction.
        Taxation, welfare and democracy, however, *have* to ontologically respond to such abstractions, and to that extent, cannot be informed by a normative ethic that insists otherwise.

        And yet, I cannot abandon an ethic of care entirely.
        For once, *caring* reminds me that we may have other, more intimately personal capacities (or duties?) for goodness and desirable taxation, welfare and democracy may consequently have to leave room for caring to flourish.
        For example, I imply an ethic of care when I later suggest that taxation should respect the promises of (mutual) care in marriage and family and not discourage, nor commodify such unions.
        More broadly, a good welfare system might have to carve out realms where such necessarily *priceless* care can be extended --- not *exchanged*! --- and might have to reallocate resources to those, especially women, who spend much of their energy caring for others, without compensation.
        Something akin to ethics of care are also implied by some proponents of deliberative democracy, maybe including those who stress the importance of story-telling in democratic participation [@Poletta2006].
        Deliberative formats may also raise ethical questions of care simply because they make people engage with other people.
        Intersubjective understanding certainly requires the kind of personal relationships to which ethics of care supposedly apply.

    I know then, that I know nothing --- at least nothing consistent --- about what makes tax, welfare and democracy desirable.
    That might be a socratic moment, but not a happy one for me or this dissertation.
    It frustrates me that I can summarize these ethics only in the crudest of terms, and that I fail to synthesize them.
    Such ignorance is troubling, too, for research as this, based on a social science education as devoid of normative theory as mine:
    clearly, these theories matter for tax, welfare and democracy as for any scholarship about them.
    Tracking down the choices and controversies in tax, welfare and democracy to different ethics is important work that I have to do without, resting this work on quite murky foundations.

    All I can offer is a modicum of argumentative transparency, by labeling any downstream axioms in tax, welfare and democracy with the roughly appropriate normative ethics from which they flow.

    Because none of the above ethics are sufficient, but each of them necessary to formulate desirable tax, welfare and democracy, I subscribe neither to virtue, nor consequentialist, nor deontological, nor care ethics but pick and choose amongst them.
    I guess that makes me an ethical pragmatist of sorts, if a confused one.

    Pragmatic Ethics
    <!-- %for all the pragmatism, check \cite{Bohman1999} -->

    :   [\[itm:pragmatic-ethics\]]{#itm:pragmatic-ethics label="itm:pragmatic-ethics"}
        --- not identical with pragmatism, and never to be confused with realism or *Realpolitik* --- may best enumerate what makes tax, welfare and democracy desirable, for at least two reasons:

        1.  In pragmatic ethics, morality can progress over time [@Dewey1932], much as science advances through iterative inquiry.
            Such tentative morality implies neither relativism, nor inaction:
            there may still be absolute values out there, we just cannot be sure that we have distilled them yet, but should act on whichever approximation we have tentatively arrived at.

            Tax, welfare and democracy, too, are such inherently tentative and contingent enterprises.
            For example, when comprehensive income taxes were introduced to more neatly bifurcated class societies, the ethical quandaries of taxing labor and capital incomes might not have been foreseeable:
            labor income generally accrued to poor workers, capital incomes to rich capitalists, end of story.
            Similarly, as universal suffrage was wrung from the *ancien regimes* and liberal democracy enshrined to fend off mob rule around the same time, the limits of a merely electoral and pluralist democracy in a complex world might not have been conceivable.
            So too, no doubt, will the reforms of tax, welfare and democracy I suggest here reveal their blind spots, come progress.

            Acknowledging that our moral understanding may be imperfect, or even somewhat historically contingent, also in no way restricts us to the status quo under which this understanding was reached.
            Pragmatic ethics can be quite radical, maybe *because* it accepts its own tentativeness and contingence:
            we can "transform the character of our relation to social and cultural worlds we inhabit rather than just to change, little by little, the content of the arrangements and beliefs that comprise them." [@Unger2007 6-7].
            I am inspired by such *anti-necessitarianism* [@Unger1987], even if --- or because? --- tax, welfare and democracy are not the stuff of revolution, but rather the "indispensable if insufficient \[...\] piecemeal and cumulative change in the organization of society" [@Unger1987 xix].
            I am keenly aware that especially reformed tax and welfare, but even deliberative democracy will, at best, progress us a little further to a point where we --- probably our progeny --- can better conceive morality, and undertake further tentative transformations we cannot even dream of.

        2.  Pragmatic ethics are also, as the name implies, intensely practical.
            Pragmatic ethics cannot be conceived of in other than practical terms:

            > *"Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have.
            > Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object."*\
            <!-- %add first name, correct? -->
            > --- William @Peirce1878 [293]

            This *pragmatic maxim*, as it became later known, works well, especially for tax and welfare.
            The proverbial proof of their ethical pudding, too, lies in the eating.
            For example, a tax on income or consumption becomes good or bad greatly by how it works in practice:
            what it curtails, what it wastes or what it hurts --- very little of which can be read in the Platonic idea of either of those alone.

    Admittedly, such pragmatic ethics are fairly amorphous, and they do not constitute any of the clear-cut positions that @Zizek2003 demand in the above.
    They merely provide the normative theory under which I can organize, and justify the following hodgepodge of axioms for desirable hypotheticals in tax, welfare and democracy.
    Here then, are my positions.

    Liberal Limits and Procedure {#sec:liberal}
    ----------------------------

    Desirable hypotheticals in tax, welfare and democracy are liberal.
    They do not infringe on the most extensive basic liberties compatible with similar liberty for others [@Rawls-1971], a liberal formulation of the *Golden Rule* of reciprocity.
    These include the political and civil liberties enshrined in various liberal constitutions, but, following @Rawls-1971 *do not* extend to unencumbered private property of the means of production or unlimited freedom of contract, as libertarians would have it.

    Desirable hypotheticals in tax, welfare and democracy must be liberal both in the substance of, as well as in the process by which they bring about social chance.

    Substantively, these regimes must not constrain the lifestyles of people, except if and to the extent that such choices conflict with --- as @Rawls-1971 posited --- the choices others.
    This is, for example, a very real concern in making consumption taxes progressive, or in taxing savings, both without dictating consumption baskets or prescribing a financial biography.
    Similarly, democratic fora should encourage "*alternative* conceptions of the common good" [@Cohen-1989-aa 18, emphasis added] rather than promote a specific social change, even if such a coherent scientific agenda *could* be found.
    This insistence on a plurality of lifestyles and ideas of the good distinguish a desirable hypothetical from totalitarian zeal and hermetic ideology.

    Procedurally, desirable hypotheticals rely on democratic advocacy, not armchair guardianship to become real.
    No matter, say, the (p. ) value of a [pct]{acronym-label="pct" acronym-form="singular+short"}, its introduction must respect, as @Dahl-1989-aa has highlighted, *both* (!) intrinsic equality [-@Dahl-1989-aa 84] *and* (liberal!) personal autonomy [-@Dahl-1989-aa 97ff].
    In his influential formulation [@Dahl-1989-aa 109ff.], it can only be realized by a democratic process marked by at least:

    1.  effective participation,

    2.  voting equality at the decisive state,

    3.  enlightened understanding and,

    4.  control of the agenda and

    5.  inclusiveness
    <!-- not sure about this last one %Equality must extend to all citizens within the state.
  	%Everyone has legitimate stake within the political process.[citation needed] -->


    These criteria imply a fairly conventional catalogue of *negative* rights, or freedoms *from* and a standard formulation of democratic process (but not substance).
    Together, these liberal norms take precedence over any of the other, below axioms for desirable hypotheticals:
    in @Rawls-1971's formulation for his *Theory of Justice*, violations of any of these rights "cannot be justified or remedied by other \[...\] advantages" [-@Rawls-1971 81].
    They cannot be traded off other benefits, but can only be limited when they come in conflict with one another, as for example, freedom of speech and defamation legislation may.
    <!-- %might refer to later section on justice
    %reference, include visualization? -->


    I posit these rights (), but I also think (p. ) that for the foreseeable future, these norms may be our best, if tentative and minimal bet of what people and government should *never* do to people.
    Maybe, liberal and other deontological norms can also serve under some kind of precautionary principle in ethics:
    given at least some uncertainty over, or contradiction within other normative ethics --- especially consequentialism --- we should accept liberal limits to policy because they might help reduce some assymetric downside risks.

    Rational Preferences {#sec:rational}
    --------------------

    Desirable hypotheticals in tax, welfare and democracy are based on and help people express rationally coherent preferences.

    [@VonNeumannMorgenstern1944] have axiomatized rational coherence thus:

    Completeness

    :   \phantomsection
        [\[itm:completeness\]]{#itm:completeness label="itm:completeness"}
        For any two alternatives, $A$ and $B$, we either ordinally prefer $A$ to $B$, or $B$ to $A$ or are indifferent between $A$ and $B$.

    Transitivity

    :   \phantomsection
        [\[itm:transitivity\]]{#itm:transitivity label="itm:transitivity"}
        For every three alternatives $A$, $B$ and $C$, where we prefer $A$ over $B$ and $B$ over $C$, we must prefer $A$ over $C$.

    Continuity

    :   \phantomsection
        [\[itm:continuity\]]{#itm:continuity label="itm:continuity"}
        For every three alternatives $A$, $B$ and $C$, where we prefer $A$ over $B$ over $C$, there is a lottery comprised of a known number of $A$-lots and $C$-lots between which and $B$ we are indifferent.

        And, most controversially,

    Independence

    :   \phantomsection
        [\[itm:independence\]]{#itm:independence label="itm:independence"}
        If between two alternatives $A$ and $B$, we prefer $A$, given a third option, $X$, we still prefer $A$ over $B$.

    Such [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-rational actors can be said to have *well-formed*, *ordinal* preferences over given alternatives, and can, by @VonNeumannMorgenstern1944's work, express equivalent, unique and *cardinal* preferences over these alternatives.
    That is, if an actor can *rank* alternatives [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-rationally, she can also assign them a set of equivalent real numbers, such as willingness to pay.
    @VonNeumannMorgenstern1944's transformation of ordinal preferences into cardinal utility can be roughly imagined thus:
    [^21]
    An agent is offered many lotteries with known probabilities of the alternative outcomes in question.
    If the agent is [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-rational, her ordinal preferences dictate her choice between *any* such known probabilities revealing her *expected* utility function, including those probabilities where she is indifferent between alternatives.
    Probabilities being cardinal, the agent's choices between them reveal her cardinal utility from the alternatives.
    A [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-rational agent's ordinal preferences can thereby always be expressed in some cardinal utility function, and vice versa:
    if an agent has a cardinal utility function over ordinally preferred alternatives, she must be [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-rational.

    Crucially, cardinal *utility* thus revealed need not be a linear function of some cardinal *value*:
    agents *expected utility* may differ from the *expected value* of some outcome, where its value is merely multiplied by its probability.
    Agents, can, for example be risk averse and display a correspondingly concave utility function.
    [^22]

    In the social sciences, expected utility theory --- as its brethren the first theorem of welfare economics --- often arouses great passions:
    it is either considered elegant and self-evident, or vulgar and misleading.
    Here too, I must briefly explicate its status:

    1.  Expected utility theory is knowledge (p. ) of the first-order flowing from a epistemology (p. ).
        It implies no (first-order, empirical) observations of actual human decision making.
        <!-- %, nor does it suggest any (second-order, normative) prescriptions of how people should decide. -->
        [^23]
        As other exercises in formal logic, it is not up to social scientific debate.

    2.  Expected utility theory invites *no* intersubjective comparisons (such as those on which the first theorem of welfare economics rest).
        Any talk of *aggregate* expected utility is meaningless, absent additional assumptions.
        That said, expected utility theory can provide no justification for any particular aggregation or comparison of individual utility, but once such aggregation has been accomplished on other grounds (for example, by democratic rule), it can posit rationality for and guide decisions based on such aggregated preferences.

    Why now, readers may ask, does any of this matter?

    Expected utility theory matters a great deal for desirable hypotheticals in tax, welfare and democracy.
    In tax and welfare it suggests the very necessary and sufficient (!) conditions under which it even makes sense to speak of utility, or its manifold incarnations in (cardinal!) economics.
    Markets can work their hypothesized magic of pareto-optimization under the first theorem of welfare economics if, and only if people can express their preferences [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-rationally.
    If people displayed, say, preferences between good $A$ and $B$ depended on a luxury good $C$ becoming available in a market [@Frank2010a], the whole intellectual artifice of "utility" and any pursuant neoliberal imperatives with it, may crumble.
    Tax and welfare may have to step in, to rectify the original irrationality.
    Conversely, to justify any of my desired welfare interventions into the market economy is to argue for enhanced expected utility:
    assuming (reasonably, I think), that people prefer an $A$ of no insurance premium, livelong health, to a $B$ of some insurance premium, cared-for sickness, to a $C$ of some insurance premium, livelong health, to a $D$ of no insurance premium, uncared-for sickness, but suggesting that, when they give the probabilities and their risk aversion some thought, people (should) find $B$ to be of maximal expected utility, is to invoke @VonNeumannMorgenstern1944.

    The case is even clearer in democracy.
    On the one hand, [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-rationality specifies what can be accepted as ordinal preference inputs (votes), if their bearers (citizens) are to have some consistent expected utility in the face of risky choice (strategic voting!).
    On the other hand, these [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"} axioms must also be accepted by any democratic aggregation mechanism --- even if, absent meaningful intersubjective comparisons, @VonNeumannMorgenstern1944 cannot justify any particular mode of aggregation.
    As I hypothesize later, popular tax choice under pluralism may well be plagued by irrational, inconsistent preferences of voters, and suboptimal choice in tax may, in part, be attributed to an aggregation mode that exploits these flawed preferences.
    <!-- %add reference -->
    Conversely, it appears that even assuming [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-rational voters, aggregative democracy alone may not be able to produce minimally attractive decisions.
    <!-- %add references -->

    Expected utility theory not only serves me to elucidate such *a priori* consequences, my normative conviction goes further and deeper.
    To speak of rationally maximizing utility, as I wish to do, *is* to imply @VonNeumannMorgenstern1944, at least for now.
    Without their axioms for rationality, we do not know what we are talking about when we say "utility", and conversely, without their formulation of utility, we do not know what we are talking about when we say "rationality".
    If the two are to mean anything, I suspect, they must be related in the terms that @VonNeumannMorgenstern1944 have worked out.

    Pragmatic Utilitarianism {#sec:utilitarian}
    ------------------------
    <!-- %this title also doesn't work well. -->

    Desirable hypotheticals in tax, welfare and democracy maximize outcomes that are valuable to people.

    Unfortunately, such a utilitarian axiom raises more questions than
    it answers, including:

    1.  [\[itm:aggregation\]]{#itm:aggregation label="itm:aggregation"}
        How do we aggregate value over different people?

    2.  [\[itm:utility\]]{#itm:utility label="itm:utility"}
        How can we know what people value?

    I cannot explore these questions in full, let alone answer them.
    Yet, to suggest desirable tax, welfare and democracy *without* raising these questions would be charlatanry.
    Without at least a tentative and pragmatic response to these questions, there can be no meaningful talk about their (p. ).

    Question [\[itm:aggregation\]](#itm:aggregation){reference-type="ref" reference="itm:aggregation"} is easier to dismiss (if not answer), so I will deal with it first.

    ### The Problem of Aggregation {#sec:aggregation}

    Utilitarianism runs into an empirical, or even ontological problem when it comes to aggregating value over different people:
    it posits an ideal observer capable of comparing value between people.
    [^24]
    Sadly (or not?) such an ideal observer is not readily available [@Rawls1988], and we do not even know whether such intersubjective comparison is ontologically possible.

    This is not to say that absent an *ideal* observer, we are off the hook.
    We *should* care about other people with whatever roundabout empathy we can muster, but, strictly speaking, we should *not* do it for utilitarian reasons.
    The last reasons for which we should care about the consequences of others are precisely not consequentialist, but may be, for instance, deontological (equality!), virtuous (charity!) or caring (empathy!).

    Utilitarianism *cannot*, as [@Bentham1789] might have hoped, reduce distributive justice to an empirical question, it can merely provide the cardinal language in which we can ask about taxation and welfare.

    Still, as I have argued above (), only (cardinal) utilitarianism can speak to the kind of aggregation that especially taxation and welfare require.
    What we must do then, is to problematize --- not presume --- ideal observation, as @Rawls1988 has demanded.
    In his *Theory of Justice*, @Rawls-1971, too, has suggested the mode for such observation that I choose here, and discuss further (p. ).

    ### The Problem of Utility {#sec:utility}

    Question [\[itm:utility\]](#itm:utility){reference-type="ref" reference="itm:utility"} on utility is even thornier.
    Behavioral economics, decision science and related disciplines present empirical findings that question whether humans have any *consistent* sense of utility, let alone a cardinal one.
    This poses much harder questions for institutional design than the cognitive heuristics and biases, because from a utilitarian perspective there can be no such a thing as "flawed emotions".
    Whatever people *feel* --- no matter how inconsistent --- are the last, and only consequences about which a utilitarian cares.
    Certainly to a utilitarian, flawed *cognition* can and should be mitigated to improve its consequences, but there are no last reasons to correct human *emotion*, precisely because these *are* the last reason.
    [^25]

    I cannot here discuss at length the empirical findings on human emotion, but illustrate the questions it raises drawing only on some of @Kahneman2011's findings in prospect theory.
    I suspect that related approaches will pose similar questions.
    In his recent summary, [@Kahneman2011] poses at least two empirical critiques of [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-like human utility:

    1.  [\[itm:inconsistence\]]{#itm:inconsistence label="itm:inconsistence"}
        Humans express their utility in inconsistent, non-[vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-preferences.
        For example, people are not just *risk averse* --- as a convex utility function might explain ---, they are also *loss averse* [@KahnemanTversky1979].
        From any given reference point, they seem to reap more hedonic gain from avoided *losses*, than from equally-sized missed *gains*.
        As people make choices, their reference points can shift, and with that, their preference over the original choice can even *reverse*:
        [@KahnemanTversky1979] find that when people have acquired mugs, they often accept only selling prices *higher* than their buying prices.

        All of this spells trouble for [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-consistent preferences, and especially cardinal utility --- or willingness to pay --- on which orthodox economics relies:
        prospect theory "is in many ways the least satisfactory of those considered since it allows individual choice to depend upon the context in which the choices were made" [@Grether1979 634].

        Such deviations from consistent utility may also affect judgments of fairness in real life labor markets, as @Kahneman2011 [L5248] notes.
        If confirmed, these findings may become relevant to macroeconomic policy and hypotheticals in welfare and taxation, too.
        If, for example, a wage cut by any given amount causes more hedonic loss than a raise by the same, or even a higher amount creates hedonic gain, *creative destruction* [@SchumpeterSwedberg-1942-aa] may not be a utility optimum, even if it nominally were a positive-sum gain.
        [^26]
        Instead, from a utilitarian perspective, a general bias to conservatism may be warranted.
        Similarly, taxation might have to be revamped to account for loss aversion.
        Speculatively, if people suffered inordinate hedonic losses when parting with market earnings, taxation might have to be *less* progressive than otherwise desirable.
        We might also have to *time* taxation so that it minimizes the *apparent* if not the real sense of loss.
        For instance, withholding taxes at the source rather than a comprehensive [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"}, or generally indirect rather than direct taxes may be loss-aversively utilitarian, even if they were conventionally inefficient.

        Interestingly, then, the equity implications of loss aversion are unclear.
        Clearly, however, the abstractions of orthodox economics, and with it, conventional desiderata for hypothetical tax and welfare, are incapable of adequately capturing prospect theory, or other non-[vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-utility.

    2.  [\[itm:undefined\]]{#itm:undefined label="itm:undefined"}
        More generally --- or equivalently? --- people may not only be unable to express consistent preferences, but there may be no such thing as well-defined utility, or subjective well-being.

        @Kahneman2011 [7056], for one, describes three different operationalizations of subjective well-being:
        [^27]

        1.  [\[itm:experienced\]]{#itm:experienced label="itm:experienced"}
            Experienced well-being, reported *as* hedonic states occur.

        2.  [\[itm:remembered\]]{#itm:remembered label="itm:remembered"}
            Remembered well-being, reported *after* some interval of hedonic states.

        3.  Hypothetical well-being, reported as the hedonic gain or loss ascribed *to* some non-outcome.
            [^28]

        If there were *one* such thing as subjective well-being, these three operationalizations --- and especially [\[itm:experienced\]](#itm:experienced){reference-type="ref" reference="itm:experienced"} and [\[itm:remembered\]](#itm:remembered){reference-type="ref" reference="itm:remembered"}, falsifiable *within-subjects* --- should yield the *same* hedonometer.
        Trivially, remembered well-being should simply be the time-integral of experienced well-being.
        Alas, it is not, as people seem to ignore duration and instead remember some (peak-end) *average* [@Kahneman2011 K7056].
        What then, do we --- and happiness researchers --- mean, when we talk about subjective well-being? Clearly, none of the operationalizations alone can be satisfactory (pun intended) [see @Kahneman2011 K7056], but together, they do not add up to any *one* concept:
        they are just inconsistent.
        Utilitarianism, and with it, orthodox economics and consequentialist hypotheticals in welfare, tax and democracy face another empirical dead-end.

    ### The Emptiness of Utilitarianism {#sec:emptiness}

    These twofold empirical dead-ends of utilitarianism pose not merely academic conundrums, they raise very fundamental problems in welfare and taxation.
    Orthodox economics --- especially the welfare kind --- and many of the concepts I take for granted here all revert back to an empirically untenable assumption of [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-consistent, subjective consequences.
    To say that an economy grows is to say that the net subjective consequences of people are improving along their [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-preferences.
    To say that an economy has a positive savings rate is to say people are foregoing part of their [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-preferences now, and store them in some material (a house) or immaterial (a patent) form that will be [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-preferable in the future.
    To a utilitarian economist --- almost a pleonasm! --- there is no *objective* value, other than [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-ranked *subjective* preferences, handily reported as utility, or willingness to pay.
    <!-- %note that it's NOT prices, correct this -- the net of the two is the consumer surplus! -->
    [^29]
    [^30]

    There may then be no *no* uncontested, objectifiable basis to value human choices and activity, as orthodox economics and much of the following desiderata in welfare and taxation.
    Even if we subscribe to utilitarianism, we may not be able to reduce desirability to an unambigous empirical question.
    [^31]
    Rather, it appears, asking about preferences, or other subjective consequences, always begs *more* questions [confer @Kahneman2011], including about the *kind* of preference consistency, or the *kind* of subjective satisfaction --- about all of which we must find some kind of agreement.

    Empirically, then, desirability cannot be reduced to a measurement of *pre-social* preferences, because these preferences, along with all that we may deduce from them, are only socially defined.
    Willy-nilly, first-order inquiries into the utility of some choice have a habit of turning into second-order questions on the social conditions under which said utility was defined, measured and expressed.
    <!-- %redundant? -->

    What then, are we to make of this emptiness of utilitarianism?

    Should we just abandon it and go for other ethics, instead? Surely, some caution is warranted, and we should back up normative claims with other ethics, because if nothing else, utilitarianism runs into these empirical dead-ends.
    [^32]

    I maintain that no matter these contradictions, we should stick to (some) form of utilitarianism, because normatively as ontologically, the world demands of us risky choices, that to choose one alternative is to negate another, and that as individuals and as societies, we must be willing and able to meaningfully trade-off desired outcomes.
    The only way to do this at a scale, and under risk is to compute, as best we can, expected utilities.
    Welfare and taxation, especially, ontologically presume, as much as they seek to improve comparable and consistent self-reported consequences.
    If we are to make meaningful normative choices between factual and hypothetical welfare and tax, we must have a notion of utility.

    But --- is that not cheating?
    <!-- %maybe this should go into the later section -->
    After all, I am justifying hypothetical taxation, welfare and democracy with last reasons that I know to be unconvincing, but posit them anyway because without them, I cannot justify hypothetical (or any!) taxation, welfare and democracy.
    Admittedly, I *am* cheating, but I like to call it ethical pragmatism, instead.
    I accept that in utilitarianism, as elsewhere, our moral judgements may be imperfect and tentative, but, to progress to greater clarity, must rely on them anyway, for three reasons:

    1.  Pragmatically, we must rely --- in part --- on utilitarian ethics because, for now, we are ontologically as empirically faced with a world that --- in part --- works according to it.
        If you want to get something (deontologically?) good done today, you will probably have to appeal to popular notions of utility, no matter how ill-conceived they might be as last reasons.

    2.  Pragmatically, it is a safe bet that whatever we will deem good in the future, will, among other things, probably require not only negative entropy, but more specifically, *stuff* that people prefer, including shelter, food and clothing.
        Of course, we may be less certain about many other things that people ostensibly now prefer --- luxury cars, computers carved out of solid aluminum, espresso machines --- and end up producing (future) "utility", that does not hold up on (future) ethical reflection.
        Still, we should better be safe with *some* attractive subjective consequences, rather than sorry without *any* such utility.
        <!-- %this should report stuff that people "roughly vnM-report" -->

    3.  Lastly, and also pragmatically, we can further --- but not perfect --- our ethical understanding of subjective consequences by problematizing, then improving those very social conditions under which we empirically seem to be forming our preferences.
      <!-- %notably, the whole social influence literature is still missing in here.
  	%Might have to add that up top later.
  	%Actually, maybe that's ok, because I am dealing with a normative theory here, and merely test whether it's empirically possible.
  	%The social influence stuff might rather go into the ontology section.
  		%!!! this is very important; both deliberation and taxation (PCT!) are actually institutions to improve this problem of isolation under utilitiaranism:

  		%!here is a crazy idea:
  	%maybe "erfahrungen auf vorrat" -- popular culture -- is in fact this; it's trying for us to get some better idea of how we might like different things, before, during and after the fact. -->
        If utility is, in fact, *not* pre-socially given, we can meaningfully *talk* about it.

        Of course, *that* is cheating, too.
        By problematizing the social conditions of forming preferences, I have just reassigned a first-order question (utility) to second-order status, a move I otherwise despise.
        To do this in a normative ethic, is really just to rephrase the question:
        after all, to *what*, if not a utilitarian standard, do you hold the social condition of preference-formation?

        I allow myself this trick not because it resolves the confusion, but simply to organize my discussion of welfare, tax and democracy.

        Welfare and taxation, are --- by definition --- the realms in which the social conditions of preference formation are *not* problematized.
        Here, I ontologically assume, and normatively require preferences to be (largely) pre-social.

        Democracy, in turn, is *the* social condition under which we form preferences in intersubjective deliberation.
        [^33]
        Here, I ontologically assume, and normatively require preferences to be (largely) social.

    Justice as Fairness {#sec:fair}
    -------------------

    Desirable hypotheticals in welfare, tax and democracy are just if they treat people fairly.

    Justice --- especially *distributive* justice --- deals with *men in the plural* as @Arendt1958 demanded of political theory, and regulates competing claims between people.
    As we have seen, some of the previous ethics tell us little about how to resolve conflicts *between* different bearers of rights, virtue, consequences or care, respectively.
    Deontological liberalism provides some digital rules, but these tend to be either minimal, or overly restrictive.
    Consequentialist utilitarianism promised to make aggregation an empirical matter, but cannot do so convincingly.
    Crucially, neither of these ethics suggests how conflicts over the meaning of, or conflicts between competing claims can be resolved.

    Here again, I turn to John @Rawls-1971 to provide a meta-standard for finding desirable hypotheticals.

    In his influential "Theory of Justice", he provides that standard:
    *justice as fairness*.
    Ever the liberal [and similar to above-mentioned @Cohen-1989-aa], he suggests *no* definite desiderata, but instead proposes a thought experiment under which moral claims have to qualify to be admissible for consideration.
    In his thought experiment, @Rawls-1971 imagines an *original position*, where deliberators know nothing about their endowments, status and power in the real world.
    Only moral claims that can be defended under such a *veil of ignorance*, suggests @Rawls-1971, may --- but need not be --- just.

    Oddly, this imagined original position is *almost* a liberal procedure for justice, or a normative claim of the *second* order --- but not quite.
    The veil of ignorance, is, of course, materially impossible and operates only metaphorically.
    Justice as fairness, is, instead, an *end-state theory of (distributive) justice* [@Fried1999 1007].
    Genially, Rawls has thereby crafted a standard of *substantive* justice, avoiding both the contingency of immediate imperatives ("\[shellfish\] shall be an abomination to you", Leviticus 11: 8, KJV), the nihilism
    [^34]
    under procedural prescriptions ("Law to Rectify the Destitution of the People and the Empire", Berlin 1933) and the vagueness of substantive universalisms ("life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness", US Declaration of Independence 1776).
    If ever there can be a synthesis between natural and positive law, it must be similar to Rawls.
    <!-- %\citep[90]{GutmannThompson-2004-aa}:
    	%``This kind of public philosophy would avoid the dichotomy that has come to dominate contemporary discussions of political theory, which poses a choice between basing politics on a comprehensive conception of the good, on the one hand, or limiting politics to a conception of procedural justice, on the other.
    	%We can and should avoid choosing either of these approaches exclusively.'' -->

    @Rawls-1971' Theory of Justice suits me, because as a liberal proposal, it lets me "economize on moral disagreement" [@GutmannThompson-2004-aa K226].
    Moreover, both Rawls' original position and the distributive justice he deduces from it, align neatly with deliberative democracy and progressive taxation of (postpaid) consumption, as I argue in (p. ).
    
    <!-- %hehe, so you're choosing a standard that you know will work well? That's a not playing fair.

    %or maybe, include the difference principle here already if it works for both deliberation AND PCT? and what about the LVT?

    Meta trade-offs
    ---------------

    These are the axioms for desirable hypotheticals in tax, welfare and democracy.
    I hope they will garner wide-spread support.

    Admittedly, the aforementioned axioms are woefully unspecific to design the institutions of tax, welfare and democracy.
    For the time being, they must remain so.
    I develop them into domain-specific desiderata in later chapters.

    The aforementioned axioms have also not resolved all conflicts between initial, tentative desiderata nor have they resolved the contradictions between different ethics.

    I suggest two modes of resolving such conflicts.

    1.  In part, I resolve these conflicts *by hierarchy*.
        Following @Rawls-1971, desirable hypotheticals must be liberal and must maintain the most extensive basic liberties compatible with similar liberty for others.
        Such norms --- as is typical for deontological ethics --- are *categorical*:
        these liberties are either given, or not.
        Such categorical values may also conflict, as for example, freedom of speech and human dignity may, in cases of alleged defamation.
        In these cases, desirable hypotheticals are those arrangements that satisfy *both* freedom of speech and human dignity until and unless they conflict.
        Crucially, neither norm is superior and they cannot be continuously traded off one another:
        there is no *amount* of cardinally "more" free speech that would justify a cardinal loss in human dignity.
        Categorical values defy trade-offs.
        What we must look for, instead, are *intersecting sets* in a figurative Euler diagram, as in (p. ).

        \centering
        ![Euler Diagram of Three Values[]{label="fig:euler-values"}](euler-values){#fig:euler-values width="100%"}

        All remaining values must be reconciled within this intersect of categorical values of liberalism.
        Here too, even supposedly outsized cardinal gains in any of the remaining values cannot be traded off nominal violations of categorical values.

    2.  In part, I resolve these conflicts by offering trade-offs.
        This works only for values that are continuous in their realization, as may be the case for the tired conflict between equity and efficiency in taxation.
        I suggest that the trade-offs offered by such conflicting, continuous values depend crucially on the institutional context under which these trade-offs have to be engaged.
        Calling trade-offs, and designing the conditions thereof can be illustrated well in a diagram of [ppfs]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="plural+short"}, frequently used in economics to illustrate different possible baskets of goods that can be produced by an economy.
        Because paper as this is two-dimensional, [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"} diagrams frequently only show two goods, but the abstraction carries to any number of $n$ goods in a basket.
        I adapt the traditional [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"} in (p. ).

    \centering
    ![Production-Possibility Frontiers of Two Competing Values[]{label="fig:ppf-values"}](ppf-values){#fig:ppf-values width="100%"}

    What are competing goods in a [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"} diagram are here competing values $I$ and $II$.
    Let us assume for the sake of simplicity that these values can be easily measured and are ratio scaled.
    More of each value is better.
    The four [ppfs]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="plural+short"} are comprised of those possible combinations of values $I$ and $II$ which are *furthest* from the origin, and thereby strictly preferable over all possible policies *under* the [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"}.
    As in a static model of the economy, the [ppfs]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="plural+short"} are exogenously determined by a priori, and posteriori limits of the first order.
    In addition, I argue, these exogenous limits are modified by *institutions* $1$ through $4$.
    Policies $A$ through $J$ are defined by specific combinations of continuous value $1$ and $2$, along the respective institutions which modify what is logically and empirically possible in this world.

    illustrates different policy choices.
    The simplest kind of trade-off is that between two policies along a linear [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"}, as between $A$ and $B$ on $1$.
    A straight [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"} implies that the values are substituted at a constant rate:
    any increase in $I$ will requires a decrease in $II$ by the same amount.
    The choice between $A$ and $B$, as all other points on $1$ is a zero-sum proposition.
    As we shall see, trade-offs in welfare, taxation and democracy are frequently, if implicitly, presented as such zero-sum choices.
    Alternatives of this sort are inevitable, but they are also normatively less interesting.
    Once values $I$ and $II$ are reduced to the same scale, the choice along the resultant [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"} becomes trivial or even arbitrary.
    [^35]
    <!-- %add refs to later misunderstandings here -->

    [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"} $4$ is curvilinear, and more interesting.
    Here, the rate of substitution varies over different levels of $I$ or $II$.
    For example, around $G$, you have to give up relatively little in $I$ to gain relatively much in $II$.
    The reverse is true around $H$, and substitution is roughly constant around $J$.
    The trade-offs between $I$ and $II$ are non-zero-sum:
    you can gain more than you loose.
    Assuming a reasonable aggregate indifference curve (linear or convex), optimal policy will probably lie around $J$.
    As we shall see, concave or other curvilinear [ppfs]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="plural+short"} abound in welfare, tax and democracy.
    Recognizing the convexity of trade-offs offered by any given institution, or, if possible, moving from lower, linear [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"} $1$ to a higher, convex [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"} $4$ will be important to identify desirable hypotheticals.

    [ppfs]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="plural+short"} $1$ and $3$ are both linear, but they have different slopes.
    At any level of $I$, compared to [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"} $1$ you have to sacrifice more in $I$ to increase $II$.
    The moves *along* curve $3$ are otherwise as normatively uninteresting as those along [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"} $1$ --- the two are just scaled differently --- but the choice *between* these two institutions will be very consequential.
    Compared to institution $1$, institution $3$ will always make it costlier to increase value $II$.
    There are many such consequential choices of institutions in tax, welfare and democracy.

    [ppfs]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="plural+short"} $1$ and $2$ both have the same slope, but $2$ is further from the origin.
    By definition, all policies along this higher curve are preferable to all policies on the lower curve --- to everyone.
    [^36]
    This is the most important of institutional choices to be made.

    <!-- %hehe, here's a pretty big part of the story missing:
    %the DEMAND side.
    %You'd need indifference curves!

    %note how justice as fairness falls in-between these \ldots it's somewhere in-between all of those

## The Ontoloty of the Doable Hypothetical

<!-- %ontology is the stuff that I am dealing with

%``(\ldots) every research agenda must start from some basic assumption about human nature, and the assumption of my research agenda is that despite all the evil in the world, at least some humans have, some of the time, a sense of goodness in truly caring for the well-being of others.'' \cite[7]{Steiner2012} -->

> *"But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?"*\
> --- James @Madison1788 [143]

Doable hypotheticals are preferable to others because, in @Dahl-1989-aa's words, "we must avoid comparing ideal oranges with actual apples" [-@Dahl-1989-aa 84].

Deciding just what can, and cannot be done is hard.
If asked as a positive first-order question, the answer is sometimes empirically unclear.
If turned into a second-order question --- as the social sciences are prone to do --- the answer becomes politically contested.
Both extremes do not serve us well:

1.  When all inquiries into the social world are reduced to positive, first-order questions the social sciences effectively abolish themselves and make the status quo epistemologically endogenous, as in:
    *social inequality is inevitable human nature, because if it were not, it would not be observed*, or "the Laws of commerce are the laws of Nature, and therefore the laws of God." (@Burke1790 as cited in @Marx-1867-aa [834]).

2.  Conversely, when such inquiries assign all positive questions to second-order status, the social sciences hermetically seal themselves off from other disciplines and turn critique into futile, infinite regress, as in:
    *"social being \[...\] determines \[...\] consciousness"* [@Marx1859 Preface], including, one might add, Marxist consciousness.
    <!-- %find out that one piece that argues that social scientists are leftist because they get paid by the state -->

Instead, the social sciences --- and especially policy analysis --- should find a middle ground, taking on *one second-order question at a time*, while provisionally leaving all other questions to first-order status.

I here ask second-order questions about the welfare state, taxation and democracy and I therefore assume these *institutions* to be malleable.
*Not* under study here are (p. ) or the (p. ), especially of developed states and late capitalist economic production.
I assume these to be constant in the medium run and reasonably approximated in the following sections.

Human Nature {#sec:human-nature}
------------

Any second-order prescription for how to organize production, distribution and decision making rests on assumptions about human nature.
For evolutionary anthropology, psychology, behavioral economics and other offspring of now disreputable [@Wright1994] sociobiology [@Wilson1975] this is a positive first-order question about our prehistoric baggage:
what behavioral, cognitive and emotional dispositions might have been adaptive in the environment of our evolution, and what do we observe today?

### Evolution and Morality

Maybe, evolution deserves to be the master ontology of life, and therefore, of human life, too.
Because I sometimes refer to such Neo-Darwinian arguments [@Wright1994] and hear them often misunderstood I must reiterate the ontological status of the theory of evolution:

1.  Evolution may dispose us to think, feel and act in certain ways, but does not determine us to do so (*deterministic fallacy*).

2.  Evolution yields more ("gradual" according to Neo-Darwinism) or less ("punctuated" according @Elrdredge1972) stable *equilibria* between environmental conditions and (more or less) adaptive traits of organisms.
    It does not necessarily yield *optimal* configurations, just survival of the relatively fitt*er*.
    Conversely, not all biological features that are observed are necessarily adaptive, but may simply be side consequences of other, adaptive features or developmental vestiges [@Gould].

    Or, in @Bryson2003's succinct formulation, "life wants to be, but it doesn't want to be much" [@Bryson2003].

3.  [\[itm:nonmoral\]]{#itm:nonmoral label="itm:nonmoral"}
    Evolution is a "nonmoral" process [@Gould1982].
    It may tend towards greater complexity and cooperation, including human-like intelligence [@Wright2000], or it may just pursue a random walk, departing from a "left wall" [@Gould1994 4] of "simple beginnings" [@Gould1977 7], and inevitably bring some complexity, including *homo sapiens* as a freak outlier [@Gould1996].
    Either way, even if evolution *were* directional, it would not be along any moral dimension intelligible to humans.
    This cuts both ways:

    1.  to praise evolutionary results is to fall for a *"naturalistic fallacy"* (@Moore1903, as cited in @Wright2000 [K5987])

    2.  to criticize them on any moral basis is to commit a *"moralistic fallacy"* [@Davis1978].

Within these ontological limits, evolution serves me well in this dissertation, because as a materialist, positive and first-order perspective it allows me to limit my second-order inquiries on taxation and democracy.
<!-- %include examples! -->

Unfortunately, evolutionary logic has a way of straying beyond the positive, of encroaching on and negating normative questions, precisely because it purports to explain all life, including human life.
For example, if exclusive fitness were operative in human evolution, does that not, as Social Darwinism suggested, imply that humans *are* unequal, end of story?
More fundamentally --- and less obviously ideological --- if all our flesh, including our brain tissue, evolved in an aimless process, does that not, as overzealous neuroscientists like to test, imply that whichever subjective experiences of consciousness and free will that flesh reports must be wholly illusory, and all questions of morality therefore beside the point?
If we were merely organic, delusional robots, as @Wright2000 [Chapter 23] provocatively asks, what would be wrong with unplugging a few?

This pedestrian thesis is not the place for another mind-body debate, and I am equally awed and outmatched by these and other "hard problem(s) of consciousness" [@Chalmers1995].
Still, I must ask the reader to allow me a crude bit of lay metaphysics.

For starters, positive questions on consciousness --- including the downstream issue of free will --- easily run into seemingly obvious logical problems.
If consciousness were positively illusory, who would be left to do the observing?
Conversely, if consciousness were some positive emergent neuronal phenomenon, would not precisely that physical genesis negate subjective experience?
Either way, infinite regress ensues.
Perhaps, as James @Trefil1997 muses, consciousness "is the only major question in the sciences that we don't even know how to ask" [-@Trefil1997 15] and maybe, therefore, we need not be bothered, for now.

More fundamentally, whatever we may learn about the (aptly named) "neural *correlates* of consciousness" (for example, @Koch2004, emphasis added) none of this positive research can, or ever should negate, or infringe on normative questions.
The first-order positive questions of natural science, and the first-order normative questions of the social sciences should be kept neatly apart, because they are [noma]{acronym-label="noma" acronym-form="singular+short"} [@Gould1997].
Akin to science and religion, first-order positive and normative questions, too are distinct "domain(s) where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution" [@Gould2002 3]:

> *"The magisterium of science covers the empirical realm:
> what the Universe is made of (fact) and why does it work in this way (theory).
> The magisterium of religion extends over questions of ultimate meaning and moral value.
> These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry (consider, for example, the magisterium of art and the meaning of beauty)."*\
> --- Steven Jay @Gould2002 [6]
<!-- %add first name, correct? -->

No matter then, how hard-nosed a question we may ask about our evolved nature, these positive inquires must never be mistaken for, or negate normative questions, because these fall into categorically different realms:

> *"Our failure to discern a universal good does not record any lack of insight or ingenuity, but merely demonstrates that nature contains no moral messages framed in human terms.
> Morality is a subject for philosophers, theologians, students of the humanities, indeed for all thinking people.

*Ought may imply can* [@Kant1794 65], but they are still not the same thing.
However much constricted positive science may find us to be, these limits of what we *can* do must never drown out the imperative *ought*.
Perhaps, tautologically, to be human and not another animal, is to arrogantly insist that, in spite of the limited and banal flesh we are made off, we *ought* to be conscious, we *ought* to have free will and we *ought* to say "ought".

Maybe, this is the this-wordly obedience to Jesus Christ that Dietrich Bonhoeffer meant --- and died for --- when, faced with fascism he chose "costly discipleship" [@Bonhoeffer1937]:
"Only he who shouts for the jews is permitted to sing Gregorian chants" (Bonhoeffer 1933 as cited and translated in @DeGruchy1999 [35]).
Fascism, after all, was the modern ideology to radically negate any "ought" for whichever group ("race"!) was supposedly biologically superior, and de-facto militarily stronger.
<!-- % \cite[662]{Hilberg}
	%"Himmler remembered this (social darwinist) theory when he addressed the mobile killing personnel at Minsk.
	%He told them to look at nature:
	%wherever they would look, they would find combat.
	%They would find it among animals and among plants.
	%Whoever tired of the fight went under." -->
Perhaps, such rejection of "ought", too, makes the "banality of evil" that Hannah [@Arendt1963] recognized in an Adolf Eichmann on the stand in Jerusalem.
Eichmann, after all, might "excuse\[...\] himself on the ground that he acted not as a man but as a mere functionary \[...\] since after all, someone had to do it" [@Arendt1963 K286f.].
Such *acts of state* defy *ought*, because, to an "unthinking" Eichmann [@Arendt1963 K187f.], history --- as evolution --- just *is*.

Such lay metaphysics might be crude, but they are *not* entirely beside the point of welfare, taxation and democracy.
As I argue later, a milder, but similar conflation of *can* and *ought*, of second-order positive, and first- and second-order normative questions plagues some social science, especially when it (, p. ).
In the social sciences, too, the line between an emerged, evolved, "grown order" and a "made order" is sometimes blurred, negating political *oughts* --- and not always as elegantly and explicitly as by [@Hayek1973 37].

### Evolution and Institutions

We need not confine evolutionary explanations to our biology alone, or, conversely, reduce all behavior, cognition and emotion to some strictly physical (genetic) reason.
Instead, we can apply evolutionary explanations to *culture* and *institutions*, too.

In fact, the tired --- and often unproductive --- nature vs. nurture controversy is moot:
we are neither blank slate
[^37]
for behaviorism to condition or society to write on, nor a physically determined animal, but essentially *both* nature and nurture.
Our bodies and culture-ready brains genetically *co-evolved* with co-adaptive memes [@Dawkins1976] to make us the "hypercultural species" that we are [@Henrich2007 K175].
Relatively ill-equipped in instincts, we need to *learn* (or *imitate*) what to eat and hunt --- and how to build a blast furnace.
Perplexingly, it is in our *nature* to rely on *culture*:
as our brain allowed us to learn easily, our culture developed cooking, and our digestive tract adapted to broken-down proteins, as illustrated in (p. , @Henrich2007).

![The coevolution of nature and culture, with some examples](coevolution-nature-culture){width="100%"}

\scriptsize{Own illustration, based on \citet[K120ff]{Henrich2007}}
[\[fig:coevolution-nature-culture\]]{#fig:coevolution-nature-culture label="fig:coevolution-nature-culture"}

This is the evolutionary blockbuster of humans:
we moved the locus of our evolutionary adaptation from genes to memes [@Dawkins1976].
<!-- %\citeauthor{Van-den-Berghe-1981-aa} 6
	%"cultural evolution is much faster than biological evolution, and its transmission is Lamarckian, rather than Darwinian.
	%Acquired cultural characteristics, unlike in genetic evolution, can be transmitted, modified, transformed or elimianted through social learning." -->
Instead of "hard-coding" all adaptive traits, we learn (or imitate) the more complex and more malleable software of culture (@Boyd1985, @Henrich2007 [K196ff]), written not in [dna]{acronym-label="dna" acronym-form="singular+short"}, but coagulated into institutions.

Paradoxically, as the naturally hypercultural species, we might gain some leeway from our biology, but simultaneously loose it to culture, because evolved culture too, must be (co-)adaptive to our biology, environment and, crucially, our *past*, path dependent culture (*evolutionary anthropology*, for example, @Wright2000).
As sociologists like to say about institutions --- the coagulates of culture --- culture, too, may *enable us as it constrains us* [for example, @Hodgson2006 3].

Here lurks another positive first-order dead end:
if present culture is, by definition, sufficiently (co-)adaptive to persist, does that not imply that any new, improved culture could and *would* emerge by said evolutionary process if, *and only if*, it were (co-)adaptive to our nature and environment and sufficiently incremental from past culture?
If, therefore, culture and institutions, too, were strictly positive phenomena unamenable to human will, would the social sciences and political critique not be completely beside the point?
<!-- %cite Neiman somewhere in here? for example, http://www.fortschrittsforum.de/debattieren/bildung-modernisierung/artikel/article/bequemlichkeit-ist-was-fuer-realisten.html#tx-comments-comments-163 -->

Hardly so.
Here, as in all evolutionary arguments, the *can* need not, and must not eclipse the *ought*.
We may not be able to make arbitrary institutions, but, axiomatically, we *can* build *progressive* institutions:
they help us achieve normative ends, by first responding to our evolved cultural and natural dispositions, then transcending them.
At least since Enlightenment dawned, we get to make our own history (a little), and build or break (some) institutions as an act of will --- that is (p. ).
<!-- %note here the danger with hayeks and brookes carefulness about changing institutions; they risk naturalising evolutionary outcomes if they're not careful.
  %anyway cite in here the discussion of being careful, spektical about institutional design.
  %what I have in here is very much the Paine position from the great debate; take institutions and make/break them at will. -->

To build institutions is to emancipate ourselves from the meaningless process that bore us as expendable containers of "selfish genes" [@Dawkins1976] and to heed that call for morality, that we among the earth's animals may hear clearest, because through institutions, we *can* turn reflexive on our innate behavior, cognition and emotions.

The Modern Condition {#sec:modernity}
--------------------

Maybe this is as good a definition of modernity as any:
the project by which we reflect on what might be innate to our existence and inevitable about our physical world, and deliberately build institutions accordingly.
Thus advises a machiavellian [-@Machiavelli1532] @Mandeville1714 to turn "private vices by dextrous management of a skillful politician (...) into public benefits" [-@Mandeville1714 213], thus threatens a somber [@Hobbes-1651-aa] our inner wolves with an even more powerful metaphorical beast, and thus asks us a moralizing [@Smith-1776-lq] to receive from others "from their regard to their own interest" --- or any number of other "idea\[s\] of the world as open to transformation, by human intervention" [@Giddens1998 94].

Modernity, as evolution, is often misused or misunderstood, and so again, I must briefly clarify its ontological status for my purposes:

1.  The modern project need not be confined to a specific location or era, nor need it be one-directional or linear, but it might arise in different places at different times, it might wax and wane, explode and collapse.
    While Europe and North America in the early 21st century may constitute high points in this project, the modern project is not wedded to any specific historical context or even the institutions which it bore, but rather, modernity is a *cultural* and *cognitive* phenomenon [@JonesJones-2003-aa 26, emphasis added].
    <!-- %include reference to diamond on the arbitrariness of why modernity happened in western europe -->

2.  The modern project need not be inherently good nor necessarily lead to desirable outcomes:
    modernity may well bear alienation [@Adorno1966], or even lead to catastrophe [@Bauman1989] and not all of its (ongoing) advances may yield progress.

    However, the inverse is true:
    to think progress implies a modern mindset, and to get it done requires modern institutions.

3.  It should be redundant to say that my dissertation ontologically assumes a modern condition, because tautologically, sociology is about finding answers to the questions modernity raises [@Harriss2000 325], and "postmodern sociology \[therefore\] an impossibility" [@Miles-2001-aa 169].

    And yet, "modernity" seems to be a concept fallen out of fashion, superseded by (occasionally loose) talk of various post-isms (for example, @Lyotard1984, Baudrillard) or second and reflexive modernities [for example, @BeckBonss-2003-aa].

    Whatever the value of these and other contributions, in welfare, taxation and democracy I find no contradictions that would require such categorical labels or the nascent theories they stand for.
    In fact, I suspect that a thoroughly *modern* analysis of welfare, taxation and democracy may resolve many of those contradictions which reflexive modernity prematurely identifies, and clarify some of the uncertainties in which postmodernity revels.
    For instance, maybe, equipped with a rational and deep understanding of the mixed economy and externalities, we find that "de-nationalization" [@BeckGrande-2007-aa] and "risk society" [@Beck-1992-aa] are neither inevitable, nor particularly descriptive but simply avoidable and unsurprising cooperation problems, instead.

    I here reflect on many dysfunctions of the presently observed, undoubtedly modern institutions of welfare, taxation and democracy, but I need not get "all meta" about modernity, because precisely such "reflexivity is a modern, not postmodern set of attitudes and practices and that ritualized postmodern caviling against modernity is ahistorical and inaccurate, not to mention dispiriting" [@Sica-1997-aa 1119].

    Also, as I promised earlier, this *is* a pedestrian thesis.

What then, are these indispensable modern institutions that I here assume as ontological entities, that which defines the "doable"?

### States and Markets

For the production and distribution of goods, they are state plan (but not *nation state*) and market exchange (but not any particular x-*capitalism*).
For collective decision making, they are a state equipped with an effective monopoly on the use of force and devoted to some popular participation [compare @Giddens1998 96].

These two, states and markets, both *brought* and *constitute* the modern condition:
they hyper-charged functional differentiation [@Smith-1776-lq] to reach near-planetary breadth (for example, international trade, citizenship) and near-universal depth (for example, commodification, family law), they altered or replaced much of the evolved culture (for example, kin) and institutions (for example, tribe) adaptively fit only at smaller scale [@Diamond1997], replaced such mechanical by organic solidarity [@Durkheim-1893-aa] and bore a social world that is complexly interacting [for example, @Merton-1968-aa; @Merton-1936-aa].

These two are also the meta-institutions that both define and allow welfare, taxation and democracy.
Welfare and taxation exist only, as I explain later, in mixed economies of both market exchange and state plan.
Taxation and democracy alike, to become real, must be enforced by a state with an effective monopoly on the use of force.

As all modern institutions, state and market are based on a particular model of human nature, in this case, a

1.  rational and
<!-- %also included in the axioms -->

2.  individual

3.  utility-maximizing
<!-- %also included in the axioms -->

*homo economicus* [maybe first in @Mill1848].
The state gets an amoral, but opportunistic *homini lupus* to behave by threatening monopolistic force [as in @Hobbes-1651-aa].
The market, in turn, lures a self-seeking, but rational "butcher, \[...\] brewer, or \[...\] baker" into providing "our dinner" --- and all else --- "from their regard to their own interest" [@Smith-1776-lq].

### Non-Zero-Sumness {#sec:nonzero}

But, as other modern institutions, state and market not only assume this human nature, they also allow homo economicus to transcend her own limits.
As *individual* utility-maximizers, she runs into problems whenever her supposed selfishness prevents otherwise mutually advantageous interactions.
This rough typology specifies the class of games which homo economicus is ill-equipped to solve:

1.  *Zero-sum* games display constant sums of payoffs over all cells, or possible interactions.
    One player's gains equal another player's losses:
    the cake does not grow, but is only sliced up differently.
    By definition, a zero-sum game is pareto optimal:
    no one can be made better off, without making someone else worse off.
    [^38]

    Terms of trade, the ratio of units of goods that a country has to export for any unit of imports, is an oft-cited (rare) example of zero-sumness in advanced economies.
    <!-- %add citation -->

    A trivial example of zero-sumness, theft, (without spillovers) is illustrated in :
    all cells yield the same $\sum{\text{payoffs}}=2$.

2.  *Non-zero-sum* games have different sums of payoffs, or possible interactions.
    One players gains are not equal to another players losses:
    the cake can grow or shrink.
    Positive-sum games are equivalent to negative-sum games, because the absence of a loss (a negative-sum outcome) is a gain (a positive-sum outcome).
    For the sake of simplicity, I often refer to only gains or positive-sum outcomes, but mean all non-zero-sum games.
    Crucially, non-zero-sumness does not imply that gains are shared equally, or at all.
    Non-zero-sum games need not even imply (weak) pareto-improvements, if one players looses less than another gains in a Kaldor-Hicks-improvement [@Kaldor1939; @Hicks1939].

    Non-zero-sum games further break down into:

    1.  *Games of total harmony* are situations in which self-interested players will @Nash1951-equilibrate at an interaction that reaps all non-zero-sumness.
        [^39]
        By definition, a game of total harmony offers pareto improvements:
        at least one player *can* be made better off, (at least) without making someone else worse off.

        Under some assumptions, opening up to free trade famously is such a game of total harmony [@Ricardo1817].
        It is roughly illustrated in :
        at $\sum{\text{payoffs}}=6$, the north-western cell yields the highest, social optimum and it is also the only (!) set of mutually best responses, and thereby, the unique Nash equilibrium.
        In short:
        trade and other games of perfect harmony should take care of themselves.

    2.  *Cooperation problems* plague non-zero-sum situations where the social welfare optimum is not also (at least) *a* Nash equilibrium.
        Here, at least one player may gain more than all others stand to loose.
        Such games cannot be Pareto-, but only Kaldor-Hicks improved.

        The canonical example of a cooperation problem, a [pd]{acronym-label="pd" acronym-form="singular+short"}, is given in :
        here the socially optimal (smallest) payoff $\sum{\text{payoffs}}=2$ prison years its in the north-western cell, but it does not constitute a mutually best response.
        In fact, no matter what the other player does, one is always better off betraying:
        the south-eastern cell is not only a mutually best response and thereby the Nash equilibrium, but even a mutually *dominant* strategy at a dismal aggregate prison sentence of $\sum{\text{payoffs}}=6$ years.

        The [pd]{acronym-label="pd" acronym-form="singular+short"} and related cooperation problems can model many of the economic and political challenges facing us today, including global warming [for example, @Stern-2006-aa] and herding in financial markets (from @Keynes1936 to @Banerjee-1992-aa).
        I also identify [pd]{acronym-label="pd" acronym-form="singular+short"}-style problems in welfare, taxation and democracy.

: Ricardian Trade as a Game of Perfect Harmony[]{label="tab:trade"}

\scriptsize{
    Home country and Rest of the World can decide to open up to trade or remain under autarky.
    Because both countries have different opportunity costs, as per \citeauthor{Ricardo1817}'s theorem of comparative advantage, they both stand to gain from trade, if possibly unequally.

    Payoffs are the baskets of goods to be consumed.
    Higher is better.
    As always, cardinal numbers are examples, only ordinal relations matter.

    Trade cannot be adequately modeled in two-dimensional payoff-matrix with only two players because, trivially, if one player reverts to autarky, the other player must also choose autarky because there is no trading partner left.
    I ignore that problem here by assuming that the rest of the world will always find some exogenous trading partner.

: The Prisoners' Dilemma as a Cooperation Problem[]{label="tab:PD"}

\scriptsize{
    Prisoner A and Prisoner B are both arrested, but police has insufficient information for a conviction.
    The two are separated, and police offers both independently the same leniency deal:
    if one betrays the other, she will go free, and the other prisoner goes to jail for 2 years.
    If both betray one another, they will both go to jail for 3 years.
    If they both stay silent, they will only be charged with a minor crime and get 1 year in jail.

    Payoffs are years in jail.
    Lower is better.

If we are to reap the (great) benefits of non-zero-sumness, homo economicus must be able to successfully play these classes of games.
She should do well in games of perfect harmony that cater to her selfish utility maximization, but might flounder cooperation problems.
As a maximizer of *individual* utility, she cannot see the bigger picture of aggregate welfare.

Such is, for example, the logic of a @Hobbes-1651-aaian war of everyone against everyone:
all would be better off if they ceased fighting, but in a world where everyone is armed and angry, any individual homo economicus better not be a pacifist.

: Security as a Prisoners' Dilemma[]{label="tab:PD-security"}

\scriptsize{
    Two homo sapiens are both living in a \citeauthor{Hobbes-1651-aa}ian primordial state of war.
    They can either be peaceful \emph{obis} (latin:\ sheep), or violent \emph{lupus} (latin:\ wolves) to their fellow men.
    To be violent is costly, but promises a meal of sheep-like humans, or at least their resources (food, shelter).
    If you are eaten, or, more benignly, robbed of food and shelter as a peaceful sheep, you receive no payoff, because either way, you must die or starve.
    If two wolves meet, both engage in costly violence but receive no extra resources.

    Payoffs are utility, as in food or shelter.
    Higher is better.
    As always, cardinal numbers are examples, only ordinal relations matter.}
In a more realistic model with many players instead of just two, the cooperation problem may only exacerbate.
If you were the only wolf amongst many sheep, violence may be especially cheap, because your potential victims are plenty and helpless.
Conversely, being a lone sheep amongst many wolves will be especially risky for the sheep, and costly for the wolves who need to be competitively violent.
At such a larger scale, the [pd]{acronym-label="pd" acronym-form="singular+short"} of security evolves into an arms race with ever costlier, but fruitless violence:
the original tragedy of the commons [@Hardin-1968-aa].

Naturally "stuck in-between" [@Lehrer2012] the selfishness of homo economicus and our capacity for altruism,
[^40]
as ever the "hypercultural species" [@Henrich2007 K175], cooperative exploitation of non-zero-sumness, as much else, does not come to us robotically, or by instinct as it does to the eusocial insects [@Wilson2012].
In humans, such cooperation is *contingent* on culture or institutions.

### The Genesis of Cooperation

Luckily for us, history listened to @Hobbes-1651-aa and brought such an institution for large-scale cooperation, when it bore those powerful *Leviathans*, whom we have since successfully trained into rule-of-law, and even democratic states.

Two theories of the genesis of states are instructive here:

1.  Maybe, states are simply the largest remaining of pre-historic, atomistic racketeers who threatened *with* well as *protected from* violence [@Tilly-1985-aa 182].
    These initially small-scale racketeers morphed into proto-states and then states as new technology, and --- equivalently --- economies of scale allowed them to produce and distribute violence at a larger scale, for lower cost [@Tilly-1985-aa].

2.  Or maybe, (nation!) states grew out of kinship ties and our capacity for genetic nepotism [@Hamilton1964; @Axelrod1981a], as the initially real blood lines became ever thinner and eventually illusory and fake, yet effective [@Van-den-Berghe-1981-aa; @Gellner-1983-aa].

The two stories need not be mutually exclusive, but may instead complement one another.
After all, @Tilly-1985-aa's materialist account of state genesis does not so much explain away the cooperation problem, but reverts it to the level of individual thugs who make up the racketeering mafia.
As Coppola's "Godfather" trilogy illustrates (1972, 1974, 1990), even in the 20th century, successful organized crime is difficult, and hinges on trust.
Anecdotally, in the case of the Corleone organization, cooperation is built on family ties, alluding to theories of inclusive fitness as nepotism.
Maybe, economies of scale and first genetic, later imagined nepotism *both* drove state making, only at different levels.
<!-- %note that this matters for the later argument on property! Take this up somewhere! -->

Against this backdrop, the development of governance in the modern era, including sequentially security, the rule of law, democracy and welfare [compare @Marshall-1950-aa] is a project of *both* consolidating, and steering a powerful but dangerous monopoly on violence or illusion of kinship, respectively.
Absent such training, states are quite scary beasts, as @Hobbes-1651-aa's frontispiece of *The Leviathan* illustrates.
Both theories of their genesis imply a slippery slope.
Supercharged by economies of scale in the production of violence, those monopoly producers of violence may tend towards parasitic government.
"Imagined communities" [@Anderson-1983-aa], in turn, enabling cooperation by increasingly fabricated nepotistic sentiment, may always risk turning exclusive, or even fascist if the quasi-biological notions run loose.

Here again, the modern age has borne deliberate (meta?-)meta-institutions to govern an evolved structure, including constitutions, rule of law and democracy.
However, all these modern additions to statehood should not distract from its defining innovation:
an effective monopoly on the use of force, without which we are back to a very, very dismal square one.
"You cannot get to Jefferson and Madison without going through Thomas Hobbes" --- in Iraq [@Diamond-2004-aa], or elsewhere.
<!-- %page number missing -->

Modern markets, and the intricate games of perfect harmony they provide for homo economicus to solve and thrive, too, depend on this monopoly of force.
From property rights, to contract law and fiat money, commerce always rests on effective enforcement:
to enter any such deals in the first place, you must believe that really, *pacta sunt servanda*, that promises *will* be kept --- or made to be kept, anyway.

It is, in fact, this shadow of violence that enables markets in the first place, that allows us to *transform* cooperation problems into games of perfect harmony, and thereby, to *solve* them.

States and markets are, the atomistic reading of @Hobbes-1651-aa and @Smith-1776-lq aside, a feat of great cooperation.
Almost magically, they freed us off that @Malthus1798ian curse, by which our geometric population growth must always outstrip our *arithmetric* economic growth, and starve us.
[^41]

The modern escape from that iron law of population (or resources, or carbon, and so on) *was*, *is* and *will* be to make economic growth above-linear, too:
to reap non-zero-sumness, to functionally differentiate and to harvest economies of scale.
If at different altitudes of abstraction, these all imply the same prescription:
cooperation *is* our one ticket out of hardship and subsistence (a notion to which I return in the in , p. ).

Contingent Homo Economicus {#sec:contingent-homo-economicus}
--------------------------

To think about welfare, taxation and democracy, then, homo economicus is both inescapable and inadequate.

### Inescapable Homo Economicus

As an ontological model, homo economicus is inescapable, because it comes part and parcel with the meta-institutions of state and markets.
To think of coercive power or supply and demand is to invoke an individual utility-maximizer.
By extension, to ponder welfare, taxation and democracy, too, implies this view of human nature, for if we were neither *individual* nor *utility maximizers*, altruism, allocation and decision making would come to us automatically.
Alas, it does not.

#### Materially Possible.

Moreover, market and state, along with their view of human nature are good ontologies for a second-order inquiry into welfare, tax and democracy because market and state, if nothing else, are materially possible under first-order theory.

Market and the state may not be the only materially possible means to organize cooperation, but they are the only (meta-)institutions that have demonstrably orchestrated large-scale production and distribution of many kinds of goods.
They, and the (p. ) they tap into are the *only known* way to prosperity.

For now, only states can solve commons problems [@Hardin-1968-aa for example,], and only markets efficiently and credibly gather, process and signal dispersed information [@Hayek1931].
Other institutions to facilitate cooperation, such as kinship [@Van-den-Berghe-1981-aa; @Hammond2006] or even the nuclear family (on which the conservative/continental welfare state still relies heavily, according to @Esping-Andersen-1990-aa) and community [@Ostrom1990] are often narrow in scope and reach.
Self-organizing scientists (for example, The Human Genome Project), programmers (for example, Linux OS) and web-users (for example, Wikipedia) have lately accomplished impressive achievements, but their mode of production seems to complement state and market, rather than replace it:
scientists are often paid state salaries, free software runs on commercial hardware, and wikipedians need day jobs.
These goods, incidentally, are also all common or public goods, the non-state production of which we are only just beginning to understand [@Ostrom1990].

Eventually, great hopes set in volunteerism, a communal "governing the commons" [@Ostrom1990] or some other alternative mode of production, distribution and decision-making may come to fruition.
In the meantime, we must stick to at least a bit of state and market, the two meta-institutions which, empirically, have civilized whichever aspects of homo economicus we might positively harbor into the intricately complex interdependency of the modern world.

This interdependency is, as I have explained, the very *condition* of our prosperity.
Modernity and its riches, we can only hope, are here to stay [@Diamond-2005-aa] and any first-order ontology, must --- as states and markets do --- abide by its conditions.
The modern economy is, and *needs to be* so functionally differentiated that no subset of people can ever organize, let alone meet all their material needs in isolation.
Only elegant abstractions, such as global price systems, can enable this feat of cooperation.
Likewise, modern society is so complex that no large share of society can ever comprehend, let alone decide on all matters of the polity.
Only some people, some of the time, can comprehend in some detail and decide on some matters.
In modernity, autarky is always regress.
[^42]

Small-scale, intimate interactions, such as of the ancient polis or the prehistoric tribe will not, and should not return.
Any ontology or policy that purports a return to such simpler times does not, as it might claim, provide an *alternative* to state or market, but instead merely defines away the question which these meta-institutions *have* answered and threatens to roll back modernity.

#### Logically Consistent.

Homo economicus and the meta-institutions it inspired also make for a good ontology for hypotheticals, because whatever its shortcomings, at least, we have a *logically consistent understanding* of states and markets, and know something about how they work, and how they fail.
If you assume some homo economicus in us, an appeasing Leviathan, and the pareto-improving qualities of free markets, are, in fact, logically consistent.

These abstractions ride on a lot of (heroic) assumptions, but at least, they clarify our thinking and generate falsifiable hypothesis.
That is more than can be said about suggested remedial institutions such as "governance", "Big Society" (Cameron 2011) or a philanthropic "Third Sector" [@Anheier2002].
These, as many other recent contenders of states and markets, are shrouded in impenetrable ("problem solving", "community" and "giving back", respectively) (p. ), they lack a coherent (*any?*) model of human nature, and give no account of their successes and failures.

Civil society, in particular, is yet only negatively defined (it is *not* the state, *not* the market and *not* the family), its mode of production (volunteerism?) is underspecified and its vaguely optimistic ignorance of structure and material interest border on (hegemonial?) ideology.
Here, too, defining away the contradictions of modernity will not solve them, it will merely render the advocated institutions inaccessible to critique and improvement.

### Inadequate Homo Economicus

Yet, homo economicus is the kind of quasi-evolutionary concept that blurs theory and data, and easily eclipses *ought* with *is*.
Less metaphysically, it is also plainly inadequate to investigate welfare, taxation and democracy because these projects, as states and markets, more generally, are, and always have been plagued by precisely these selfish demons of our nature.

#### Logically Incomplete.

Homo economicus is logically incomplete as a first-order ontology, because it cannot explain the initial nucleus of cooperation from which states and markets must have sprung.

The infinite regress of an ontology inhabited only by homo economicus is evident in the competing (or complementing) theories of state genesis referenced earlier.
@Tilly-1985-aa's (and similar) stories of state-making-as-organized-crime do not so much explain *Leviathan*-level cooperation, as they merely relegate it to the level of nascent racketeers:
just *how* these thugs initially ganged up, we do not know.
@Van-den-Berghe-1981-aa's (and related) stories of polities-as-extended-kinship, likewise, do not so much explain *Imagined Communities*, as they simply relegate it to a sociobiological explanation of reciprocal altruism:
just *how* reciprocal altruism emerged at a *group* level, in an evolution of *individual*-borne genes and memes, we do not know, and even sociobiology is unsure.
[^43]

Whatever their genesis, states, markets and modernity may well *need* such nuclei of cooperation to sustain themselves, even today.
In fact, much of their current crises might be described as the inevitable wreckage of pure homo economicus.

This dissertation, too, chronicles the limits of homo economicus as much as it ontologically rests on this view of human nature.

#### Empirically Incomplete.

Luckily for us, this rational, individual utility-maximizing model of human nature may also be incomplete --- but not entirely incorrect --- on all counts:
humans may be hard-wired altruists [for example, @Zak2004], are only boundedly rational [@Simon-1999-aa; @Kahneman2011], poor planners of utility [summarized in @Gilbert2006], think in relative, not absolute terms [@Frank2005] and display diminishing marginal utility [@Ng-1997-aa; @Veenhoven-2000-aa; @Nickell2008].
<!-- %check these references with the abote stuff on utility -->

Homo economicus provides, in other words, at least an *incomplete* description of human nature.

#### Domain-Specific Homo Economicus.

Nevertheless, and because homo economicus is both inescapable and inadequate to investigate welfare, taxation and democracy, we should make this model of human nature and its related (meta-)institutions *domain specific*.

<!-- %compare this to micro-macrocosm stuff from hayek in fatal conceit
	%Russ: And besides the quote we mentioned earlier, it has this wonderful quote, which I've recited a few times, about the microcosm and the macrocosm: that we are socialists when we come, deal with our family and friends.
	%We have an egalitarian streak that came out of our--he attributes it to our emergence from hunting and gathering bands of small groups--that now that we have this extended group of society, we have an impulse to extend that, those attitudes toward our larger group.
	%He says that will lead to tyranny.
	%And similarly he says that if we try to take that role the prices play in the macrocosm and bring it into our family, we will destroy our family.

	% I do see some striking parallels between some of Hayek's criticism of collective rule and the deliberative criticism of pluralism; both are highly skeptical, and sometimes for similar reasons, of any aggregative institutions and (plausibly?) list a number of possible failures (rent-seeking, special interest, veto playing, ...). It's sad that we probably won't have much time to discuss deliberative theory in class (have to cut things somewhere). The crucial difference between deliberative theory and Hayek seems to be that Hayek says very little about the genesis of individual preferences, which to him, are completely exogenous. It seems that he accepts von Mises (1949) dictum that "human action is purposive behavior", which strikes me as a quite heroic axiom, devoid of any possible falsification. Deliberative theory, by contrast, holds that preferences (and, more broadly, human cognition) is, in fact, social, and thereby contingent – rejecting the validity of pre-social preferences.
	% I am not sure I agree with you that Hayek's work could be taken to negate intrinsic value of human life, or even individual human beings. His criticism of collective rule (including market interventions) strikes me as too consequentialist (it's bad, because it leads to bad things) – and not so much deontological (as might be said of Nozick). So maybe, we ought to give Hayek the benefit of the doubt ... maybe he really was a humanist, who just happened to be very, very skeptical of our capacity for collective choice. He writes in "The Fatal Conceit": “The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.”
	% In a similar vein, he also warns in the Fatal Conceit of confusing the conditions of the microcosm (by which he means friends, family, ... maybe teams, people who know each other ...) with the macrocosm ("the society" as he and Thatcher would say :). I think this warning might very well be read to imply a critique of "economization" of too much of the lifeworld, that is so often associated with neoliberalism.
	% If you're further interested in Hayek's work/perspectives, I recommend the EconTalk podcast http://www.econtalk.org/, which is hosted by a quite thoughtful Hayek fan. I've been listening to this podcast for a couple of years now, and it continues to irritate me – but also stimulates. Seems like a good idea to understand another view from the inside out ... -->

Even if, as I suspect, there are no alternatives to state or market in *some* realms of modern society, we need not "economicize", commodify or regulate *all* aspects of life.
Instead, different tasks call for different modes of production, distribution, decision making and associated views of human nature, as summarized in .

\scriptsize{Own summary, but similar to \citealt[52f.]{Schmitter1985}}
At the economy or industry level, markets may be our best bet, but perhaps not at the firm or team level, where we can tap into other human motivations.
Similarly, a state may need to impose health and safety standards, but not a teacher's lesson plan (as @Schwartz2010 alarmingly report).
Market and state, along with their impoverished view of human nature, *can* be applied selectively, to some domains.
As alternatives become available,
[^44]
market and state can recede.
[^45]
For the time being, I suspect, the domains exclusive to market and state will remain considerable.

In this dissertation, I constrain homo economicus to the realm of the market, and summarize welfare and taxation policies to remedy, as well as make do with its shortcomings.
In democracy, by contrast, I find a realm in which homo economicus can no longer be accommodated, but where we must instead find new (deliberative) institutions to tap into other, better angels of our nature.

### No New Man

Neither policy nor social scientific ontologies can ask for a *new man*.
For better (see above) or for worse [for example, @Schwartz2010]
[^46]
state and market made their own humans:
as we live under hierarchy and competition, we adapt to it.
In the [oecd]{acronym-label="oecd" acronym-form="singular+short"}-world and in our time, many people (including me) will expect and respond to incentives and regulation.
Consequently, political institutions have to reckon with homo economicus, even if --- and because --- it is partly of their own making.

Good policy and good social scientific ontology does not ask for a new man, but makes do with the women and men we have now, but at the same time, recognizes that for our "hypercultural" species [@Henrich2004], homo economicus, as other views on our indeterminate nature will always be highly *contingent on institutions*.

None of this is to preclude a study or reform of human nature, modern society, states or markets.
Rather, such a contingent ontology is, to me, the *only* way to study these meta-institutions and their incarnations in welfare, taxation and democracy.
*Some*, ontologically contingent homo economicus can clear our hazy eyes, but *too much*, ontologically endogenous homo economicus will blind our "sociological imagination" [@Mills-1959-aa].
Contingency and domain-specificity lead the middle way between the hermetic ideology of utopias, and the apolitical mindlessness of *TINAs*.

Also, none of this is to proclaim state and market as the "end of history" or to blazon homo economicus as "the last man" [@Fukuyama1992].
Rather, state and market along with their homo economicus are the *only* place to start from, if we want to write, or make history in welfare, taxation and democracy today.
Precisely because our nature is contingent on institutions, that is where we must start:
institutions are *all we got*, "just because institutions are the kinds of things that can can be changed directly, whereas cultures and psychological dispositions are less subject to collective intervention and experimentation" [@WarrenPearse-2008-aa K182].
States and markets are those prime meta-institutions through which we can make, and remake the institutions of welfare, taxation and democracy.
Through them, we respond to the homo economicus in all of us, and unfold our greater capacities.

And transcend the limits of homo economicus, we must.
Clearly, we face grave problems in (, p. ).
Clearly, too, disintegration is not an option:
that way lies regress and hardship.
And clearly, further rational-functional or identity-embellished integration is not an option:
that way lie democratic deficits, and exclusionary identity politics.

These are the challenges cut out for us.
To fail them, to fail these cooperation problems of non-zero-sumness, is to fail specifically as a human being, the one "conspicuously exceptional" species [@Frank2011 85] that is *socially capable* of great cooperation, but not *biologically determined* to give up individualism [@Wright2000], and is therefore reliant on institutions.
Welfare, and especially taxation and democracy are those modern institutions, to square the circles of individuality, inequality and cooperation.

And these are the institutions I here assume to be malleable, to make up the desirable and doable hypotheticals, whose absence begs explanation.
These, too, are the institutions that moderate the very contingency of homo economicus, and our other natures.
As such, they are precisely the place to look at, taking on one second-order question at a time, leaving all else to first-order status.

For sociology, "the science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning" [@Durkheim1895 45], this, I would hope, is a good approach as any to learn --- as we must --- whether, and under which (institutional!) circumstances humans are "knights, knaves, pawns or queens" [@LeGrand2003], what our capacity for altruism is [@Henrich2007] and how it can be fostered [@Axelrod1981a], all to imagine, and then fulfill our human capacity of non-zero-sumness [@Wright2000].

[^1]: By hypothetical, I mean an alternative state of the (*dependent variable*) world.
    In history [recently reviewed by @Bunzl2004] and political science [for a methodological appraisal, see @Fearon1991], the similar term *"counterfactual"* sometimes refers to alternative (*independent variable*) events in the past.
    I ask what *could be*, not what *would be*.

[^2]: Not to put too fine a point on it, but the language of these epistemological mudfights is conspicuously evocative of gender:
    quantitative research is frequently referred to as *hard* science, and qualitative and ideational approaches are often considered *soft*, *understanding* perspectives.

    This section is based, in part, on earlier, unpublished work which I submitted to the Hertie School of Governance in [@Held2012a].
    I have labelled said work as early drafts of this dissertation, and have since revised and expanded it.

[^4]: Physicist @Krauss2012 has pointed out that strictly speaking, *why* questions are teleological:
    they imply purpose.
    Positive social science --- as physics --- need not assume such purpose, and therefore better ask *how* questions.
    I use the two interchangeably.

[^5]: To deny such social choice, and to easily feeds into an ideological affirmation of the status quo (, p. ).

[^6]: Formal logic and empirical finding are not as neatly divided as I make them out to be.
    Frequently, formal models generate the hypotheses that empirical works set out to falsify.
    Conversely, inconsistent empirical findings inspire new, better formal modeling.

    Still, in the way of this boundary-blurring also lie ad-hoc fallacies.
    When formal logic and empirical finding become too closely enmeshed, the resulting hypotheses may become unfalsifiable.
    [@Popper1976] has thus criticized (some) Darwinism for being unfalsifiable, because any possible observed biological trait must, tautologically, have been adaptive for otherwise it could not have survived --- a critique that has since been (mis)appropriated by creationists.

    More relevant here, much of the modern infatuation (and outrage) with general equilibrium economics, might be explained by a similar, unhappy but popular conflation of brilliant formal logic [@Walras1874; @Debreu1954] with murky assumptions on human nature on which that logic supposedly operates, thereby morphing equilibrium economics from tentative model to hermetic ideology (@Cassidy2010 tells the entire, sad story).

[^7]: Also, wryly observe @GutmannThompson-2004-aa, "for most people, the freedom not to spend a major part of one's time deiberating about politics is part of what it means to live the life of a free citizen" [-@GutmannThompson-2004-aa 30].

[^8]: I assume economic production to be approximately described by mainstream (neoclassical?) textbook economics [including @Mankiw-2004-aa; @FrankBernanke2004], expanded by some ventures into welfare economics [@Hicks1939; @Samuelson-1954-eu], game theory (founded by @VonNeumannMorgenstern1944 [@Nash1951], expanded by @Axelrod1981a, recently summarized by @Kleinberg-2009-oz) and network theory (for example, @Mandelbrot2004, @Jackson1968 also recently summarized by @Kleinberg-2009-oz).

[^9]: Demonstrated first graphically by [@Lerner1944], mathematically by [@Lange1934], [@Debreu1954] and others.

[^10]: And falsified, it has been:
    for example, [@Alvard2004] on fairness, not utility, [@Zak2004a] on reciprocity, not self-interest, [@KahnemanEtAl1982] and [@Simon-2001-aa] on biased and bounded, not complete rationality.

[^12]: The first question of sociology, according to @Dahrendorf1966 [66].

[^13]: In 2012, a political scientist, paraphrasing [@Wittgenstein1998], described the current expectations in German political sciences to me thus:
    "whereof one cannot measure, thereof one must be silent".
    <!-- %ask for permission to quote genschel -->

    The same political scientist also opined --- maybe slightly in-jest -- that "excellence is finishing on time", referring to the [bigsss]{acronym-label="bigsss" acronym-form="singular+short"} application for federal excellence initiative funding.

[^14]: For the distinction between first-order and second order questions, I am indebted to Claus Offe, who first suggested I should develop a second-order theory of social conflict on tax choice.

[^15]: For example, @Tilly-1985-aa's work on the genesis of the state might be construed as learning from the (almost) no-longer-occurence of @Hobbes-1651-aaian anarchy.
    He might have said --- although he presents his argument differently --- that the un(!)-desirable hypothetical of atomistic war is no longer observed because, luckily, through a process of extraction and violence-production, supercharged by economies of scale, once fearsome racketeers nilly-willy evolved into states with an effective monopoly on the legitimate use of force [@Tilly-1985-aa].

[^16]: For example, logarithmically diminishing returns to wealth, according to [@Bernoulli1738].

[^17]: Similarly, utilitarianism characteristically side-steps the *distribution* of utility.
    For example, @Mill1863 famously suggested to maximize "the greatest good for the greatest many", which might be understood to imply constant marginal returns, thereby equating equity with efficiency.
    Before him, @Bernoulli1738 suggested that utility might be a logarithmic function of wealth, implying diminishing marginal returns.
    Crucially, no matter the specific aggregative function, utilitarianism reduces *distributive justice* to a merely positive question about human psychometrics, from which one or another *hedonic calculus* [originally @Bentham1789 Chapter 4] must follow.

    I return to these, and other distributive norms when I discuss (p. ).

[^18]: John @Rawls-1971, ever the critic of utilitarianism, has instead suggested an *ideal*, *original position* under which these decisions can be fairly made.

[^19]: Writes @Arendt1958, maybe *the* proto-deliberative theorist:

    > *"Ohne Gleichartigkeit gäbe es keine Verständigung unter Lebenden, kein Verstehen der Toten und kein Planen für eine Welt, die nicht mehr von uns, aber doch immer noch von unseresgleichen bevölkert sein wird.
    > Ohne Verschiedenheit \[...\] bedürfte es weder der Sprache noch des Handelns für eine Verständigung."*\
    > --- Hannah @Arendt1958
    <!-- %page missing -->

    And, similarly, in the english translation:

    > *"Men in plural \[...\] can experience meaningfulness only because they can talk with and make sense to each other and themselves."*\
    <!-- %page missing -->
    > --- Hannah @Arendt1958 [Prologue]

[^20]: I later return to medium-term dependence on such arguably impoverished interactions in (p. ) and suggest a (p. ).

[^21]: Caveat: the mathematics escape me.

[^22]: Maybe because they experience logarithmically diminishing returns to utility, as [@Bernoulli1738] suspected.

[^23]: In fact, [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-rationality has a fairly poor empirical track record.
    Behavioral economics, cognitive psychology and related empirical disciplines demonstrate that "humans are not well *described* by the rational-agent model" [@Kahneman2011 K7094, emphasis added].

    As far as these findings concern *cognition*, they do not pose great problems.
    Notably, the research in this field I am aware of does not suggest that humans would be *categorically* incapable to be [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-rational, or form otherwise coherent preferences.
    @Kahneman2011, for one, suggests that we think fast but sloppily most of the time (under "system I"), but can also think slowly and thoroughly (under "system II").
    In fact, prospect theory and other behavioral economics proceed by comparing actual human decisions to *a priori* [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}, or otherwise rational choice.
    If no one else, at least the people doing this research must be able to think rationally.

    I (p. ) accept these conditional limits of human rationality and suggest --- as @Kahneman2011 [K7094] --- we build *rational* institutions that help us make better decisions (p. ).

[^24]: Only consequentialist ethics that rely on *subjective* consequences run into this problem.
    A (state) consequentialism seeking to minimize, say, CO2 emissions, is defined in aggregate terms already.
    If minimal emissions are *the* last reason, it does not matter, for example, who sacrifices how much.
    Of course, it would be hard to justify such a consequentialism with no reference to subjective consequences and any choice of objective may become arbitrary.

[^25]: Readers may note that I allow utilitarianism to collapse a normative question into an empirical question --- a conflation that I later criticize in other arguments.
    This conflation is, in fact, inherent to utilitarian arguments.

[^26]: Note that current macroeconomic policy aims to curb exactly the kind of downward wage rigidity that we might expect from loss-averse workers.
    Inflation is set at a positive rate to hide *real* wage cuts at *nominally* constant rates.
    Of course, as buying power decreases, workers *will* eventually experience some hedonic loss, even though they may not readily attribute it to real wage cuts.
    Speculatively, if loss aversion loomed large, as utilitarians, we should cherish (!) downward wage rigidity and make sure that it operates effectively, even if we thereby forego gains elsewhere in the economy.

[^27]: ...not to be confused with the debate over happiness as a state, or a trait [for example @StonesHadjistavropoulos-1995-aa].

[^28]: For example, a quadriplegic might be asked how much happier she would be without her medical condition.

[^29]: This problem also plagues public/social choice and finance:
    to a utilitarian economist, there is *no* known value to public goods (such as defense), because by definition, markets do not operate on public goods and can thereby not extract an exchange value to approximate subjective preferences over such goods.
    Instead, governments usually undertake some form of [cba]{acronym-label="cba" acronym-form="singular+short"} to make production decisions.
    As part of such [cba]{acronym-label="cba" acronym-form="singular+short"} bureaucrats must assign (or survey) at least the supposed benefits.

    This problem is readily apparent when comparing some macroeconomic indicators between countries, or even just over time.
    An economy-wide savings rate, for example, must either ignore publicly held fixed capital
    or statisticians must impute the value of these (ostensible) investments out of thin air.
    At least by the standards of exchange valuation, there is *no* definitive value of, say, a public investment into basic research even though it would clearly be important to know about the expected future utility of these and other projects when gauging a savings rate.

[^30]: This problem may plague *all* subjective theories of value in economics, whether defined by the labor saved by, or put into a good [@Smith-1776-lq; @Ricardo1817; @Marx-1867-aa], or the utility enjoyed by the marginal consumer buying it and expressed in her willingness to pay [for example, @Walras1874].
    Either way, "labor" and "marginal utility" must be defined by [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-consistent preferences.
    Labor, after all, is nothing but an unattractive choice, which we make in return for the right to make some other, more attractive choice.
    Similarly, being a marginal consumer is to say that relative to all other economic choices (say, another good), buying the good in question at the given price is a [vnm]{acronym-label="vnm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-preferred choice.
    <!-- %this may be bullshit, my marxism is bad -->

    This radically relative conception of subjective value has been criticized as circular reasoning:
    the ordinal preferences for a good over all other goods is determined by relative, cardinal price for all other goods, which in turn are determined by the ordinal preferences for each of those goods over all other goods [confer @Mattick1978].

[^31]: Entropy may be the one, unambigously physical phenomenon to measure human activity.
    As per the second law of thermodynamics, entropy --- colloquially:
    disorder --- increases in any isolated system, including the universe.
    Life, however, *internally* increases and maintains order, by consuming negative entropy, that is, increasing *external* entropy elsewhere in the universe (for example, consider what our bodies do to a black forest cake as we metabolize it) [confer @Schrodinger1944].

    Valuable economic activity, too, may be conceived of as creating and maintaining order locally, by further increasing disorder elsewhere (for example, consider the human by-products of making a black forest cake).
    Incidentally, some sources of negative entropy for economic activity may be better than others, the carbon-cycle of our planet being a particularly poor choice to dump entropy.

    However, even if our local entropy-decreasing *could* be measured, it would presumably leave much to be desired in the way of policy guidance.
    Building a planetary reservoir of frozen black forest cakes may be an impressive achievement in negative entropy, but people will probably get tire of the desert after a while.
    Maybe, even a physical concept as entropy can only serve as a necessary, but not a sufficient criteria for value:
    whatever of value we produce will probably be fairly ordered, but not everything ordered we could produce would be valuable to us.
    In other words, even physics cannot help us get around the utilitarian problem of subjective consequences.

[^32]: Decision scientists [for example, @Kahneman2011], happiness researchers [for example, @Veenhoven-2000-aa] and whoever else presumes and/or questions subjective consequences and so much as hints at normative implications should, if only for the sake of argumentative clarity, out themselves as closeted utilitarians.

[^33]: I return to this distinction when I discuss deliberative democracy in (p. .
    Assuming and enabling social, rather than pre-social preferences is an important tenet of deliberative theory and practice.
    <!-- %%nah, this can be better, more precise. -->

[^34]: Walter @Benjamin1927 has revealed the nihilism of legal positivism:
    "law-making (...) implies power (...) which implies violence", [@Benjamin1927 12, own translation].
    In the German original:

    > *"Rechtsetzung ist Machtsetzung und insofern ein Akt von unmittelbarer Manifestation der Gewalt."*\
    > --- Walter @Benjamin1927 [12]

[^35]: In the technical terms of introductory economics, individual preferences are expressed in *indifference curves*, that is, the lines along those combinations of $I$ and $II$ between which a person is indifferent.
    The intersection between the aggregate of these indifference curves would be the optimal policy point(s).
    <!-- %is this true? -->
    If the aggregate indifference curve is curvilinear and reasonably simple, there will be one or few such points.
    <!-- %I think here's a big question:
  %are indifference curves curvilinear or linear? and why? How is this related to scaling? -->
    If, however, the aggregate indifference curve is *linear* and scaled as the [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"}, *all* policies along the [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"} intersect with an identical indifference curve, and there are an infinite number of ideal policy points.

[^36]: Technically, again, *no matter the indifference curve*, the higher, but equally-sloped [ppf]{acronym-label="ppf" acronym-form="singular+short"} will always be preferable.

[^37]: ...*aka.* *tabula rasa* or *homo sociologicus*, as [@Dahrendorf1965] quipped.

[^38]: Critics of economic growth (but not [gdp]{acronym-label="gdp" acronym-form="singular+short"}!) should carefully ponder the implications of such a scenario:
    a world with no economic growth is a world where *all* human interactions are zero-sum.
    Empirical literature on, for example, rentier economies, have chronicled the corrupting influence that zero-sumness may have on a political process, when all decisions create *nothing but* winners and losers [@Beblawi1990].

[^39]: *Strategies*, or players' moves, form a *Nash equilibrium* if they are mutually *best responses*.
    Best responses, in turn, are the utility-maximizing move for a player, *given* the other player's choice.
    *Dominant strategies* are those best responses that maximize payoffs over *all* choices of the other player(s).
    The *social welfare optimum* is realized under those combinations of strategies that maximize the aggregate payoffs of all players.
    [@Kleinberg-2009-oz] provide a great introduction into game theory and its basic concepts.

[^40]: Altruistic behavior, according to [@Wilson2012] and before him [@Darwin1859], is an emergent property of the *group*, following group selection.
    According to mainstream sociobiology [and initially @Wilson1975], altruism emerges at the *individual* level by a strategy of inclusive fitness or genetic nepotism, helping others as they are related.

[^41]: [@Malthus1798] might have been correct only about some periods of human history, and anyway, was anachronistic in his time, when functional differentiation was already well under way.

[^42]: Such regressive states of disorganization can still be observed in much of the developing world [confer @Clark2007; @Easterly-2006-aa], war zones [on the Iraq example, @Baker-IIIHamilton-2006-aa] or wherever else human culture has regressed back to or stalled in innate (kin-, clan-, sectarian) modes of cooperation [on the southern italian example, @PutnamLeonardi-1993-aa]

[^45]: As @Keynes had promised:

    > *"The day is not far off when the economic problem will take the back seat where it belongs, and the arena of the heart and the head will be occupied or reoccupied, by our real problems --- the problems of life and of human relations, of creation and behavior and religion."*\
    > --- John Maynard [@Keynes]

[^46]: [@Schwartz2010] show how excessive regulation (the mode of states) and incentives (the mode of markets) can crowd out intrinsic motivation, "Practical Wisdom" and other, better angels of our nature.
    Unfortunately, this ship has probably sailed.
    Still, their insistence on a broader, human capacity to "do well by doing good" and crusade against dehumanizing choice is important.

Taxation offers highly structured choices along the three dimensions of base, schedule and timing, the first two of which are cross-tabulated in table.
<!-- TODO refer to tax overview table here -->
There can be no meaningful democratic rule on taxation that does not ultimately opt for a definitive mix of distinct combinations along those dimensions.
The choice among these (already high-level) alternatives cannot be abstracted away, or relegated to experts:
it hinges on irreducible moral and causal judgments [for example, @McCaffery2005].

In the preceding , I have tried to shed some light on the in much of the current [oecd]{acronym-label="oecd" acronym-form="singular+short"}-world (, p. ).
The puzzle is now a little clearer:

1.  In spite of unprecendented prosperity, late [oecd]{acronym-label="oecd" acronym-form="singular+short"} welfare states are less efficient, equitable and sustainable than they could be, because they fall short of an (, p. ).
    Among the institutions of the mixed economy, especially, because it is by far the most effective and efficient tool for government to improve upon, or redistribute market outcomes (, p. ).

2.  Equipped with a deficient mixed economy and suboptimal taxation, democracies are forced to make unnecessarily unattractive trade-offs between efficiency, equity and sustainability, eroding their *output* legitimacy.
    At the same time, the legitimacy of democratic *inputs* may be undermined by a widening gap between the complexity of an advanced (mixed) economy and the simplifying tendencies of electoral democracy.
    Potentially, pluralist democracy may, in part, have fallen victim to the tightly concentrated special interest that late capitalism offers, especially in the field of taxation.

    Taken together, such diminished legitimacy in outputs and inputs, may help explain widely reported dissatisfaction with democratic performance (but not institutions) [for example, @Dalton-2004-aa] and contribute to the apparent mismatch between popular opinion and the governing abstractions of the mixed economy.

3.  Net of such constrained welfare and confused democracy, material and political equality would suffer.
    A deficient mixed economy and suboptimal taxation would corrode the social contract, by which democratic government should have some ability to redistribute the fruits of non-zero-sum
    games borne by the free exchange of state-protected property rights [compare @Crouch2004].
    Offered only unattractive choices, and thoroughly confused about the abstractions of the mixed economy, citizens would be increasingly impotent under the social contract.
    One suspects, especially poor and poorly educated citizens would be effectively disenfranchised from the social contract.

## Background

These are, admittedly, conjectures.
As first order actualities, they are puzzling only if there *are* preferable and possible first-order hypotheticals.

## Better Taxation

In the following (p. ) and (p. ), I show that under liberal-pragmatic axioms and orthodox ontology (, p. ), we could have vastly and .

Among doable taxes, a potentially supplemented by a , and/or appears to offer more attractive trade-offs between equity, efficiency and sustainability than the current tax mixes dominated by , and (see , p. ).

![The Vector Field of Taxes with Trends[]{label="fig:tax-with-trends"}](tax-with-trends){#fig:tax-with-trends width="1\linewidth"}

## Better Democracy

Among doable forms of democratic rule, deliberative democracy [for example, @Cohen-1989-aa] appears both more promising and demanding than pluralism.

Deliberation promotes egalitarian, inclusive, well-reasoned and civic-minded discussions for (possibly) consensual political decision-making.
Its normative theory draws heavily on @Habermas-1984' concept of *communicative action* and @Rawls-1971' "Theory of Justice" as fairness.
Where pluralism encourages the representation of particular interest, deliberative democracy demands *alternative* conceptions of the common good [@Cohen-1989-aa 18].
Where pluralism aggregates given, pre-social preferences, deliberative democracy is all about forming preferences.
Where pluralism assumes individual voter error to balance out, when errors are random [@Page1993; @Surowiecki2004], deliberative democracy insists on perfecting the deliberators understandings (see , p. ).

Deliberative democracy offers more attractive trade-offs between participation, enlightened understanding and political equality [@Fishkin2009] (, p. ) and promises to alleviate some of the public choice contradictions of pluralism [for example, @Condorcet1785; @Arrow1950] (, p. ).
It also transcends the impoverished, and dubious ontology of pluralism (homo economicus!), and opens legitimate rule to feminist or even virtue ethics.


## Open Second-Order Questions

These hypotheticals flow, for the most part, from *a priori* knowledge.
They are grounded in reason, but not --- as hypotheticals can never be --- in *experience*.
I have, as much as possible, supported *a posteriori* assumptions with robust empirical findings --- but I cannot provide experiential evidence for the complete hypotheticals.

In welfare and tax, comprehensive *a posteriori* knowledge about hypotheticals is hard to come by.

Inframarginal reforms as those I suggest here strain the limits of economic models, all of which must be grounded in only *marginally* known behavioral data.
For example, we would need to know the price elasticity in the demand for luxury goods, or saving and agree on (as I have shown) irreduceably normative judgments of diminishing returns or an optimal savings rate.
Natural experiments are, of course, unavailable and the external validity of any laboratory setting will be strictly limited.
There is, in other words, not much else beside *a priori* knowledge that we might learn about welfare and tax.
My reasoning here is hopefully as widely agreeable as any comprehensive account of welfare and tax, but it will surely not go uncontested.
Absent empirical clarification, we must then resolve such disagreement in a democratic process.
Taxation, in other words, probably *cannot* be reduced to a first-order question, but it, too reverts to a second-order concern on how to democratically resolve any disagreement we might have about it.

In democracy, we have some, if limited *a posteriori* knowledge about the deliberative hypothetical I here suggest.
Deliberative democracy has been successfully implemented mostly in local settings on policies of limited scope [@Fung-2003-ac; @HendricksonTucker-2005-aa].
In their proposal for "Empowered Deliberative Democracy" @FungWright-2001-aa [17] explicitly suggest what underlies much of the current designs:

> 1.  A focus on *specific, tangible* problems
>
> 2.  Involvement of *ordinary people* affected by these problems and officials *close* to them
>
> 3.  The deliberative development of solutions to *these* problems.
>
Few attempts at deliberating regional issues of greater complexity have been made, including a 'Citizens Assembly' on electoral reform in British Columbia, Canada [confer @Ratner-2008-aa].

On the one hand, deliberative theorists as @FungWright-2001-aa [17] have criticized this limited scope of deliberative attempts, focused on the immediate, tangible and "confined to the realm of neighborhood and locale", as much out of necessity, as out of conviction [@Boggs-1997-aa 759].
The associated anti-authoritarian, anti-bureaucratic, anti-functional-differentiation impetus may, as [@Sousa-Santos-1998-aa] hopes for participatory budgeting in Porto Allegre, Brazil contribute to a "counterhegemonic globalization" by concentrating on special issues like land rights, urban infrastructure and drinking water in urban settings, but may by the same token remain "Bean n' Rice works" [@Sousa-Santos-1998-aa 479].
Faced, as our polities inevitably are, with macro-level abstractions, such cherishing of "human-scale democracy" above all else may, suspects @Boggs-1997-aa, move democracy "in a defensive and insular direction, laying bare a process of conservative retreat beneath a facile rhetoric of grassroots activism" [@Boggs-1997-aa 759].

On the other hand, political psychologists as [@Rosenberg-2002-aa] have problematized the cognitive demands deliberation poses.
Recent research in political psychology suggests, that --- contrary to the bounded rationality assumption --- imperfect human reasoning may not only stem from remediable cognitive scarcity, but may be developmentally determined.
@Rosenberg-2002-aa has suggested a threefold developmental sequence and typology of *sequential*, *linear* and *systematic* reasoning.
His empirical accounts suggest that if any, only systematic thinkers will be able to meet the cognitive demands for reasoned arguments, and egalitarian free speech of deliberative democracy.
Moreover, this cognitive competence was found not to be domain specific, and while people may regress to lower levels of competence under high loads or appropriate cues, they are unlikely to easily, if ever, achieve higher than developed levels.
"Structurally (more and) less developed reasoning adults" make "not only the adequacy of citizens' reasoning, but also their *equality*" a problem for deliberative democracy [@Rosenberg-2007-aa 12, emphasis added].

Few empirical work has been done to address both these ontological and empirical reservations towards deliberative democracy.
We know very little about if and how deliberative fora do in the face of macro-level abstractions and unequally limited cognitive ability of deliberators.

## Taxes on Income

### Taxes on Capital Income

#### Corporate Income Tax (CIT)

\phantomsection
[\[sec:CIT\]]{#sec:CIT label="sec:CIT"}
The [cit]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="singular+short"} taxes the earnings
[^1]
of an incorporated firm.
It is usually proportional.
Unincorporated firms do not pay [cit]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="singular+short"}, instead their owners owe [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} on their business earnings.
[^2]

[cits]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="plural+short"} are proportional, with rates around 20% in the EU.
Countries have recently created issued sectoral (trade, finance) or regional (Hong Kong, London) exemptions from the [cit]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="singular+short"} to attract investment [@Genschel2009; @Ganghof2007; @Genschel2005].

##### Local Business Tax (LBT)

\phantomsection
[\[sec:LBT\]]{#sec:LBT label="sec:LBT"}
Taxes on local businesses exist only in some OECD countries, including Germany.
In Germany, local authorities can tax local business a progressive tax on their earnings.
Local authorities set the rate of the tax (within federally mandated margins).
Firms are taxable based on the location of their establishments.
Earnings of firms with multiple establishments are weighed by the sum of wages and salaries paid.

### Taxes on Capital and Labor Income

#### Personal Income Tax (PIT)

\phantomsection
[\[sec:PIT\]]{#sec:PIT label="sec:PIT"}
Under the [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"}, all sources of personal income (labor, capital) are added and taxed under a single schedule.
[pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} schedules are typically progressive.
Marginal (not average!) tax rates in Germany range from 14% to 42% (Bundesministerium für Finanzen 2009).

<!-- %The personal income tax is usually levied according to a progressive schedule both on labor and capital income.
%Its incidence is borne by the taxed individual, but it disincentivizes work and (risky) investment.
%It taxes capital twice:
%once when it is initially earned and again when it generates an interest.
%Income taxes only on labor (payroll tax, social contributions) can contribute to structural unemployment by raising effective price floors, especially when they are not sufficiently progressive.

%Personal income taxes on capital (\ldots
%gains tax) necessitate a corollary taxation of corporate income.
%Without it, taxpayers could easily evade payment by incorporating capital it in a firm, withdrawing earnings only slowly.
%Corporate income tax rates spill over to personal (capital gains) tax rates (Ganghof & Genschel 2008, Ganghof 2006).
%Like the personal income tax, they depress economic activity.
%Moreover, corporate income taxes are indeterminate with regard to incidence and flat in their progression.
%The tax incidence in a firm on either labor or capital is determined by a host of firm- and market-specific factors, including the relative factor price elasticities.
%Corporate income taxes apply one rate over all shares.
%The lifesavings of a worker, invested in a company through her life insurance, are taxed at exactly the same rate as the share of a stock-market tycoon.
%As the base of the corporate income tax is relatively mobile (compared to labor, consumption), it can easily evade taxation or compete down rates. -->

##### Dual Income Tax (Dual PIT).

\phantomsection
[\[sec:Dual-PIT\]]{#sec:Dual-PIT label="sec:Dual-PIT"}
The [2-pit]{acronym-label="2-pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} is a variation on the [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"}, where schedules differ between capital and labor sources of income.
[2-pits]{acronym-label="2-pit" acronym-form="plural+short"} burden capital relatively less than labor incomes.
The [2-pits]{acronym-label="2-pit" acronym-form="plural+short"} was introduced to avoid the negative growth effects of high capital taxation (particularly through its , p. ) and to counteract capital flight.

In Sweden, a pioneer of the [2-pit]{acronym-label="2-pit" acronym-form="singular+short"}, the top marginal (not average!) rate for labor incomes is 55%.
Capital incomes are taxed proportionally at 30% (marginal rate equals average rate).

### Taxes on Labor Income

#### Payroll Taxes (Payroll)

\phantomsection
[\[sec:Payroll\]]{#sec:Payroll label="sec:Payroll"}
In Germany, and many other countries, social contributions for old age, health, unemployment and long term care insurance are implemented as payroll taxes.
Payroll taxes are paid on labor income.
Whether they are implemented as withholding taxes (the employer withholds and transfers the tax) or paid out of the employees funds is of no significance here:
it does not matter for (page ).

##### Social Insurance Contributions

\phantomsection
[\[sec:SIC\]]{#sec:SIC label="sec:SIC"}
are capped [payroll]{acronym-label="payroll" acronym-form="singular+short"}, actually.
Despite this terminological confusion and their administration in semi-independent public agencies, it is important to note that social contributions are government revenue, irrespective of their quasi-fiscal status.
Social contributions are proper pages
To the extent that government adopts universal provision of health care, unemployment insurance and long term care as allocative goals, compulsory contributions to these services are .
To the extent that government finances old-age pensions out of current incomes, such PAYGO contributions are intertemporally and intergenerationally redistributive taxes.
[^3]
To the extent that private markets for health care, unemployment and long term care insurance are plagued by lemons markets [@Akerlof-1970-aa], respective contributions serve to (page ) and are proper revenue-generating taxes.
Additionally, universal health care provides provision against epidemics (think vaccinations) and unemployment insurance serves as an automatic stabilizer to smooth out economic growth.

Social insurance contributions are presented here for the sake of completion and clarification.
They are, when typically implemented as payroll taxes, a variation of a [2-pit]{acronym-label="2-pit" acronym-form="singular+short"}.

Rates for social insurance contributions are usually proportional.
In the EU, they vary from 20% in Denmark to 32% in Germany and 50% in France (Statistisches Bundesamt Deutschland 2007).
In Germany, contributions are capped above a certain income threshold, above which additional income is not taxed.


## Taxes on Consumption

### Prepaid Consumption Taxes

#### Value Added Tax (VAT)

\phantomsection
[\[sec:VAT\]]{#sec:VAT label="sec:VAT"}
The [vat]{acronym-label="vat" acronym-form="singular+short"} is best understood as an elegant advancement of a retail sales tax.
A retail sales tax charges sellers a fixed percentage of the sales price on goods for which the (corporate or private) buyer is the end user.
Because under a sales tax, the tax on any single taxable transaction is very high, incentives to evade the tax and to smuggle goods are great.
What is more, the state looses *all* tax revenue on a given good when evasion occurs.

The VAT was developed to address this problem.
Instead of charging sellers only at the end of a production chain (before the good is consumed), sellers are charged a percentage of their sales prices on *all* goods, including investment and intermediary goods.
Sellers invoice the tax to buyers.
Buyers are then eligible for refunds on their VAT receipts:
they can deduct all of *their* sales.
Instead of kicking in only at the last transaction before consumption, the VAT charges every transaction according to the value added at the respective stage of production.
It is handed down the economic cycle to whoever ultimately consumes a good.

The tax burden on any *single* transaction is much smaller:
value added instead of entire sales price are taxed.
Incentives to evade the tax on any single transaction are thereby greatly reduced.
[^4]

VATs are very common in the EU, standard rates differ from 15% (Luxembourg, Cyprus) to 25% (Denmark), with the majority of countries above 20%.
Reduced rates are frequently implemented for foodstuffs and other basic needs.

<!-- %The value-add tax (VAT) is a straightforward indirect tax.
%It has a relatively immobile base (consumption of everyone), supposedly robust revenues, and is relatively incentive-neutral.
	%The VAT is, however, regressive (poorer people spend more of their income generating capacity on consumption).
%Like payroll taxes, the VAT raises effective price floors of labor when socially acceptable minima are present, and can thereby contribute to structural unemployment.It emerges from this simplified overview that taxes with progressive schedules also tend to have relative mobile bases#.
%If mobile tax bases erode relatively more because of tax competition, so will progressive schedules. -->

##### Graduated VAT

### Postpaid Consumption Taxes

#### Progressive Consumption Tax (PCT)

\phantomsection
[\[sec:PCT\]]{#sec:PCT label="sec:PCT"}
The [pct]{acronym-label="pct" acronym-form="singular+short"} is applied to the total consumption of natural persons.
Crucially, it is *postpaid* and *cash-flow based*.

Postpaid.

:   It is crucial to understand that the PCT is *not* a VAT or sales tax of any kind with progressive rates (say, a higher rate for luxury goods).
    The PCT is not *prepaid* on the price of individual *consumer goods*, but *postpaid* on the sum of individual *consumer accounts*.
    It matters not what you consume, but how much and of what value.
    The PCT suggested here is called postpaid because the progressive rate is known and deducted only once all consumption in a given period is completed.

Cash-Flow-Based.

:   It would be impractical to collect and add up all consumption receipts.
    People usually consume very many, different things of relatively small value.
    Instead, the PCT relies on the @Haig1921-@Simons1938 definition of income in ([-@Haig1921], [-@Simons1938] respectively).
    $$\label{eq:HaigSimons}
            \text{Income}=\text{Consumption}+\Delta\text{Wealth}$$

    A trivial transformation yields a practical definition of consumption:

    $$\label{eq:HaigSimonsPCT}
            \text{Consumption}=\text{Income}-(\text{Savings}-\text{Dissavings})$$

    Consumption is simply defined as that part of income which is not saved.
    You can, after all, only either save or spend.
    People create much fewer savings receipts than consumption receipts:
    while you may have hundreds of grocery receipts, you will have only one savings account and maybe a few other financial instruments.
    In addition, transactions to save money are more thoroughly formalized:
    the bank, by necessity, keeps good track of your accounts.

Consumption out of wealth is included as a dissaving.
Consumption out of loans is also treated as a dissaving.
Payments on interest and principal are treated as accretions to wealth (saving).
They are fully deductible.

To measure the wealth of individuals, the taxman would have to list the assets and liabilities of each person.
Such *balance sheet* accounting would be very costly administratively and require undesirable evaluation of (page ).

The PCT achieves its objective through a simple *cash flow* accounting of individuals.
Instead of evaluating all assets and liabilities, the taxman merely records all cash transactions.
A dissaving is recorded when, for instance, a mutual fund is sold and its cash value wired to the checking account.
Savings are recorded when payments are made from that checking account to a qualified investment (say, a life insurance).
Incomes from labor or capital are recorded as the salary or interest are deposited on the checking account.
Consumption is recorded as cash is withdrawn or wired to a seller.

The cash flow variant of the PCT rests on the assumption that all assets are transformed into cash before they are consumed.
[^5]

Cash flow accounting is much simpler than balance sheet accounting.
In a modern economy, most cash flows are already recorded by individuals and their financial service institutions.
The taxman just needs to look into these records.
Moreover, cash flows are by definition liquid:
they constitute the equilibrium prices.
The taxman does not need to evaluate anything.

##### Illustration

I enlist @Aesop's fabled Ant and Grasshopper (c.a.
564 b.c.) to explain an example.
[^6]
summarizes incomes, savings and consumption for three archetypical taxpayers.

##### Grasshopper

earns 30,000 each year, of which he spends everything.
He had no savings at the beginning of the year, and none at the end, when winter, or rather, the taxman comes.
With no savings, all of his income is taxable at a progressive rate, of say, 10%.
Grasshopper owes 3,000 to the state.

##### Thrifty Ant,

who also earns 30,000 per year, saves 10,000.
Her taxable consumption is 20,000 at, for example, 5%, owing 1,000 to the taxman.
Ant will at some point in the future consume what she has saved, but possibly spread more evenly (thereby avoiding sharply progressive rates) and while earning an interest on her savings.
This interest is *not* income taxed, as mandated by the (page ).

##### Big Spender Lion.

Let's introduce a third beast, the Lion, who powerful as he is, earns a great income of 600,000.
He also consumes a lot (he is a predator, after all), say 300,000.
Come winter the (brave) taxman will collect a 33% due on consumption, that is 100,000.
Note, that although Lion consumes *relatively less* (50%) than Grashopper (100%), he has to pay *relatively more* taxes (33% as compared to 10%), because, in absolute terms, he is encouraged to spend less and save more, given his superior income-generating abilities.
Also note that the tax liability does not depend on the source of income.
It does not matter whether the Lion earns much because he is such a diligent hunter (labor income), or (as it happens to be), whether it is because he sits comfortably on the top of the food chain and actually sleeps most of the day (capital income).

<!-- pun: it really is a fabled tax -->

<!-- TODO is this actually a tax on a factor, rather than on wealth? -->

<!-- %note about the LVT:

	%so you might need other taxes, too.
	%it's not clear how much value add comes from this one factor

%note that the LVT requires some difficult evaluations;

%‘Theoretical’’ is an essential qualifier here, because consensus evaporates once the papers turn to real-world implementation issues.
%One such issue is emphasized by discussant Robert Solow (p.
%278):
%high tax rates on land values would mean departing dramatically from existing tax policy, with correspondingly dramatic capital losses:
%‘‘Expropriating land values today would have no semblance of fairness.
%Suppose I have just paid through the nose for a prime beach lot.
%I have no unearned increment from the land.
%If you now tax away the rent, you are in effect taxing away the savings that enabled me to buy it.
%The original appropriator of the land is long gone.’’ /this is via \cite{Tomlinson2001}


%— Adam Smith , The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Chapter 2, Article I:
%Taxes upon the Rent of Houses:
	%Ground-rents are a still more proper subject of taxation than the rent of houses.
%A tax upon ground-rents would not raise the rents of houses.
%It would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent, who acts always as a monopolist, and exacts the greatest rent which can be got for the use of his ground.
%More or less can be got for it according as the competitors happen to be richer or poorer, or can afford to gratify their fancy for a particular spot of ground at a greater or smaller expense.
%In every country the greatest number of rich competitors is in the capital, and it is there accordingly that the highest ground-rents are always to be found.
%As the wealth of those competitors would in no respect be increased by a tax upon ground-rents, they would not probably be disposed to pay more for the use of the ground.
%Whether the tax was to be advanced by the inhabitant, or by the owner of the ground, would be of little importance.
%The more the inhabitant was obliged to pay for the tax, the less he would incline to pay for the ground;
%so that the final payment of the tax would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent.

%note neutrality of the tax

%Paul Samuelson:
%Paul Samuelson strongly supported a land value tax.
%"Our ideal society finds it essential to put a rent on land as a way of maximizing the total consumption available to the society.
%\ldotsPure land rent is in the nature of a 'surplus' which can be taxed heavily without distorting production incentives or efficiency.
%A land value tax can be called 'the useful tax on measured land surplus'." (wikipedia)

%Friedman from Wikipedia:
%Milton Friedman stated:
%"There's a sense in which all taxes are antagonistic to free enterprise -- and yet we need taxes.
%\ldotsSo the question is, which are the least bad taxes?
%In my opinion the least bad tax is the property tax on the unimproved value of land, the Henry George argument of many, many years ago."

%Krugman from Wikipedia:
%Paul Krugman agrees that a land value tax is efficient, however he disputes whether it should be considered a single tax, as he believes it would not be enough alone, excluding taxes on natural resource rents and other Georgistesque taxes, to fund a welfare state.
%"Believe it or not, urban economics models actually do suggest that Georgist taxation would be the right approach at least to finance city growth.
%But I would just say:

%Experts clearly disagree about the feasibility of assessing land values.
%One way to resolve this issue would be for at least one state to attempt to implement a serious state-wide assessment of land values.

#### Negative Income Tax (NIT)

\phantomsection
[\[sec:NIT\]]{#sec:NIT label="sec:NIT"}
The Negative Income Tax (NIT) is a subsidy for low wage earners, not a tax.
It does not raise, but spends revenue.
It is included here because of its broad redistributive impact and its technical implementation as a "tax".

The NIT was suggested by Milton [@Friedman1962] as an elegant replacement for minimum wage legislation and (page ) social security transfers.
Under the NIT, workers would receive progressive transfer payments for hourly market wages below the socially acceptable minimum.
However, in contrast to current income supplements, real market wage increases are not entirely eaten up by transfer cuts:
at any given level of income, earning more on the market will leave you with more net in the bank.
For example, under a minimum acceptable hourly income of €7.50 (current minimum wage proposal in Germany), moving from a €2.00 market price to a €4.00 market price job could increase your post-tax income from €7.50 (transfer €5.50) to €8.50 (transfer €4.50), always maintaining your incentives to earn more on the market.
This may also help to counteract rent-seeking exploitation by low-paying firms.

%Tax cannot be reduced to an empirical question, both because inframarginal data is not available, and because macroeconomics is incompletely understood.
%Tax cannot be reduced to a consequentialist inquiry, because people (may) care about other normative claims, too (for example, fairness).

%Tax cannot be easily (if at all) dumbed down to subsets of tax choice (for example, VAT vs PIT), or subsets of abstractions (for example, only “bastard keynesianism”) for two reasons:
    %Any such reduction would violate the spirit of deliberation; citizens could not set their own agenda.
    %Any such reduction may well fail to elucidate my hypothesized misunderstandings: I imagine “understanding tax” as a bucket, which, if leaky will drain to the lowest level.
%For example, if deliberators would discuss most aspects of taxation, but skip over the limits (!) of price controls, they may well opt for price controls in lieu of, or in addition to taxation -->

	% briefly reference Rousseau "obsessive being-for-others" with whom "one is forced to compare onself at each instant".
	% 382: ``The possession of positional goods has also been associated with measurable levels of increased well-being, while their absence has been linked with increased stress, status anxiety and other adverse psychological and physical effects such as depression, heart disease and reduced life expectancy''.
	%382``There is some evidence of a connection between blood concentrations of the neurotransmitter serotonin—the so-called ‘happiness hormone’—and dominance. Unusually high levels of serotonin have been found in officers of college fraternities, athletic team captains and officers and crew members on an extended sailing voyage (Frank 1985: 23–8). Richard Wilkinson has linked being in a subordinate position with heightened levels of stress and depressed levels of serotonin (Wilkinson 1996). Increased levels of the central stress hormone cortisol, which can be measured in blood and saliva, have been found in individuals whose self-esteem and social status are threatened, and stress has been positively linked to The status of happiness 383 poor health and increased obesity. Low or declining social status has also been associated in some studies with poor cardiovascular health (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009: 38, 191; Marmot 2004).
	%383: Rousseau may be right, but it might be nature already: While there is some evidence that he was more or less right about this, it seems as though our preoccupation with status and relative position is rooted in our natures which, according to evolutionary psychology, are ‘adaptive responses shaped by man’s biological nature and situation on earth’ (Hirschleifer 1978: 321).
	%. ‘[T]he farther an individual fell in his local pecking order,’ according to economist Robert Frank, ‘the more serious were the threats to his survival,’ which typically provoked feelings of stress and anxiety affecting levels of testosterone and serotonin, as we have already seen (Frank 1999: 136). In such a setting, ‘low social status is an evolutionary dead end,’ to put it bluntly (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009: 204). For
	%``What mattered for survival in this environment was one’s position relative to local rivals with whom individuals and groups were in direct, immediate competition for food and sex, ‘whereas comparisons with others who are distant in time and space are typically irrelevant’, from an evolutionary perspective (Frank 2007: 57). One of the central findings of Robert Frank is that most people today are relatively indifferent to the wealth and status of people far removed from them, whereas they ‘care deeply about where they stand in their various local hierarchies’ (Frank 1985: 107). Hence,''
	%``For example, the voluntary simplicity movement seeks to overthrow ‘the god of positional consumption’ (Schor 1999: 61) in the name of reduced consumption, anti- materialism and sustainable development. A policy of deliberate ‘downshifting’ typically involves working less, earning less and consuming less so that there is more time to better enable people to pursue other goods. Such a lifestyle would be materially poorer than now but richer in non-material, non-positional goods and therefore happier. To the extent that it is possible to reduce the speed of the consumption treadmill so that less time and fewer resources are expended on the joyless pursuit of positional goods and status, we may be able to devote ourselves to more intrinsically satisfying activities and forms of consumption that actually improve our quality of life, such as higher air quality, more urban parkland, cleaner drinker water, reducing violent crime (Frank 1999: 11).''

  Without further empirical research, they cannot be known.
  The PCT will have *very* high marginal rates, possibly well above 100 %.
  Because universal, stark price hikes in the markets for excessive consumption have never occurred, we have no systematic observations regarding the responsiveness of excessive buyers to such price changes.

  So what are the alternative outcomes?

  ##### What If: People Still Consume Excessively.

  If people *do not* respond to the post-tax price hike in excessive consumption, the PCT will tax an .
  The DWL will be , as per desiderata [\[des:tax-inelastic\]](#des:tax-inelastic){reference-type="ref" reference="des:tax-inelastic"} and [\[des:minimal-DWL\]](#des:minimal-DWL){reference-type="ref" reference="des:minimal-DWL"}.
  Most of what consumers no longer enjoy in excessive consumption will be recouped as government revenue, as illustrated in .

  Producers will be perfectly elastic in their supply.
  At least in the long run,
  [^14]
  all producers can shift their production to less expensive consumer goods, or, as described later, to investment goods.
  The burden of the PCT will fall exclusively the who ultimately consume goods, as mandated in desideratum [\[des:personal-taxation\]](#des:personal-taxation){reference-type="ref" reference="des:personal-taxation"}.

  ##### What If: People Consume Less (Expensive) Things.

  If people *do* respond to the post-tax price hike in excessive consumption, the PCT gains a Pigouvian component, but one that works.
  When people consume excessively, they pay for the negative externality of defection in the (page ).
  Recall that when the Joneses buy a BMW (defect) instead of a VW (cooperation), the utility enjoyed by the VW-owning Does decreases:
  they cannot stand having the cheaper car.
  Under the PCT, the Joneses pay (dearly) for showing off their BMW.
  If their demand for BMWs is price elastic, they may buy the same VW as the Does.

  Also recall that the level of cooperation in a multiplayer Prisoner's Dilemma is a (page ).
  Contributing to cooperative behavior creates a benefit to other players from which they cannot be *excluded*.
  Establishing cooperation is, however, *rival*:
  if no one, or too few people cooperate, the benefits of cooperation will not materialize.
  Buy buying a VW, the Does contribute to a common-good-like lower level of automobile consumption, from which everyone else can invariably (relatively) benefit.
  The Joneses can exploit the thriftiness of the Does by buying a BMW (greater relative utility), or they can partake in the Does thriftiness by buying a cheaper VW (same relative utility, but lower absolute utility), without being looked-down upon by a BMW-owning neighbor.
  Either way, the Does cannot prevent the Joneses from benefiting (non-exclusion).
  The Joneses buying of a VW is, however rival.
  If they end up being the only family on the street that buys the cheaper VW, their triftinness will be inconsequential for everyone else.

  Common Goods are best financed out of Pigouvian taxes.
  The PCT is that Pigouvian tax of excessive, positional consumption.
  It falls on exactly that behavior (excessive consumption) at exactly that price (marginal rate!) which it is meant to discourage.
  If rates are sufficiently high and progressive, the PCT can effectively curb .
  At minimum, it can lower the level of material waste at which positional consumption occurs.

  ##### What If: People Don't Mind Buying Less (Expensive) Things.

  A Pigouvian tax, by definition, has a DWL.
  The DWL of a Pigouvian tax is the very consumer and producer surplus that should never have been realized, because of the social costs hidden to them.

  The definition of a DWL assumes that the utility of consumers is accurately measured in their willingness to pay.
  Utility and nominal demand curve are the same.
  (page )
  suggest that people derive utility not from absolute, but relative consumption or status.
  People want to have more, or at least not less things and status than other people.

  If excessive consumption occurs for positional gain, there *can* be no DWL when that consumption is curtailed for everyone.
  No one will be relatively worse off, only less relatively different.
  If anything, a more compressed stratification in the material signs of affluence and status will make most of us happier.

  ##### What If: People Really Care About Luxury.

  People enjoy having many, and many expensive things not *only* because they want more than their neighbor.
  Driving that BMW on the autobahn may be aesthetically pleasing and functionally faster in absolute terms.
  [^15]

  Let's assume for a minute that there really is an absolute, *sheer driving pleasure*
  [^16]
  in driving an expensive car.
  Even if there is absolute utility, it is likely to be of marginally decreasing return.
  Upgrading from a VW to a BMW will probably bestow more utility on someone than upgrading from a BMW to a Bentley.
  By taxing big spenders more, the PCT accounts for in excessive consumption.
  Even in a world of *sheer driving pleasure*, when more people get to upgrade from VW to BMW and fewer from BMW to Bentley, aggregate autophile utility will be maximized.

  #### Sky-High Progression.

  The PCT can be arbitrarily progressive.
  For very excessive consumers, rates can be as high as several hundred percent:
  literally, the sky is the limit.
  Because the PCT falls on consumption, and not on incomes, incentives or entrepreneurship will not be dramatically curtailed.

  The ultimate reason for *homo economicus* to work hard and invest wisely is superior consumption.
  At first sight, depressed consumption (at higher prices) may appear to reduce incentives.
  Consider the trade-offs for *homo economicus* under the PCT:
  She can either work an extra hour, or not.
  Because she is already very diligent, and likes to *work hard / party (consume) hard*, any additionally enabled unit of consumption will be taxed at a fairly high rate.
  At *any* rate of consumption taxation, she will still be better off if she works the extra hour.

  At the other end of the progressive schedule, rates can be very low or at zero for people who consume very little.
  Aside from equity, this also serves to labor as per desideratum [\[des:low-price-floor\]](#des:low-price-floor){reference-type="ref" reference="des:low-price-floor"}.
  If the working poor or structurally unemployed pay a zero tax rate on their necessarily minimal consumption, their living standards increase and their reservation wage vis-a-vis the socially acceptable minimum living standard drops.

  #### The PCT Smoothes Consumption.

  Under progressive tax rates on consumption, people are punished for spikes in their consumption.
  To have the lowest possible PCT rate for a given level of lifetime consumption, you have to spread out the shopping sprees as evenly as possible.
  
  <!-- %frank seems to note somewhere (source unknown, this is from economist web):
  	% that the PCT can be counter-cyclical ``If a progressive consumption tax were phased in gradually, its main effect would be to shift spending from consumption to investment, causing productivity and incomes to rise faster.
  %Should a recession occur, a temporary cut in consumption taxes would provide a much more powerful stimulus than the traditional temporary cut in income taxes.''

  %note that stabilization is always a second best, it'd be nicer if we could fight the cause of busts and booms, but, considering for a moment that we may be unable to do that, such dampers may be a good idea.
  %Also, note that if no boom/bust cycle sets in the PCT does not hurt you much. -->

  In a bust or boom, the PCT serves as an automatic stabilizer.
  Without legislative intervention, people are always incentivized to smooth out their consumption.

  The PCT can also serve as a powerful discretionary stabilizer.
  In a bust, legislatures can opt to lower the entire PCT schedule
  [^17]
  .
  For the duration of the bust, people have a greater incentive to consume, knowing that higher rates will return once the economy reverts to its long-term growth path.

  The PCT as discretionary stabilizer will be general in impact.
  *Whatever* you choose to buy will be cheaper to buy.
  Government can inject discretionary stimulus without opening up to clientelist pressures.

  The PCT also minimizes windfall effects.
  Because you have to consume first to take advantage of the lower rate, you cannot channel the government stimulus into further savings.
  In fact, you have to divert from your average consumption path, and consume *more* during the bust.
  Just as a *cash-for-clunkers* scheme, the PCT incentivizes people to *dissave*, except for all kinds of consumption and without the waste of clunkers.

  #### Deciding How Much to Consume, and Who Consumes.

  The PCT allows government to set an arbitrary savings rate.
  Because it is progressive, the PCT can incentivize saving without (see page ).
  The PCT allows for greater saving than the VAT because it (greatly) incentivizes exactly those people to save more, who can:
  the excessive consumers.

  ##### How the PCT Makes You Save More.

  The PCT offers two mechanisms to increase the savings rate.

  First, the PCT is simply an elegant revenue stream for government from which it can finance public good projects (public works) or buy investments (sovereign wealth fund).
  Both a new (non-congested) motorway and public ownership of some corporation constitute saving.

  Second, the PCT is an instrument to alter the save-vs.-consume trade-off for natural persons.
  It encourages saving in three distinct ways (the following is from [@Seidman1997 28ff].

  The incentive effect

  :   of higher post-tax interest rates is more complicated than might appear at first sight.
      Intuitively, tax exempted saving and capital incomes will increase the post-tax interest rates and cause people to save more.
      A *substitution effect* may ensue:
      for every unit of resource saved now, you will receive a greater post-tax payoff in the future.
      You save more.

      On the other hand, a higher post-tax interest rate is an accrual to wealth:
      you just got richer.
      According to the *income effect* of higher interest rates, you may save *less*.
      For fewer units of resources saved now, you will receive a same payoff in the future.
      The PCT is less ambiguous in its effects than a change in the market interest rate.
      It has only a substitution effect.
      Because people are (income) taxed before the PCT, too, introducing the PCT does not make them any richer.
      Taxation does not disappear, it merely shifts the base.
      Think this through again

  The horizontal redistribution (heterogeneity) effect

  :   occurs between *equally* affluent persons who differ in how much they consume.
      Consider two millionaires, one of whom spends all his income (affluent consumer), one of whom saves all her income (affluent saver).
      Under income taxation, both pay a (same!) tax on their millionaire income.
      Under the PCT, the affluent saver pays no tax at all, and the (price inelastic) affluent consumer pays twice the income tax for revenues to stay constant.
      The affluent saver gets to save *all* of her income.
      Under income taxation, she can save only the post-tax income.
      In sum, at same public revenues, more money is saved under the PCT than under income taxation.
      @Seidman1997 estimates US savings rates to increase by roughly 11% due to the heterogeneity effect of a PCT transition.

  The postponement effect

  :   occurs as a one-off effect as the tax burden shifts within cohorts from saving at working ages to dissaving during retirement.
      An income tax burdens savings immediately, and early in life once they are earned.
      A PCT burdens savings late in life, when they are consumed.
      At same levels of retirement consumption, people will be able to accumulate more capital earlier.

      To the extent that the postponement effect occurs *within* cohorts, it is a zero-sum intertemporal redistribution between private saving and public revenue.
      It does not, as @Seidman1997 seems to imply, generate genuine new saving in the long term.
      It just postpones government revenue.

      To the extent that the postponement effect occurs *between* cohorts, it can genuinely improve the savings rate *and* public revenue by taxing old savings twice (or even three times).
      The intergenerational equity considerations of this effect are later discussed in .

  #### It's not All Pleasure-Delaying.

  So far, the PCT appears to encourage thriftiness over all else.
  As Ant --- and even the most die-hard supply-side economist --- will attest, *that* alone would make for a fairly sad state of affairs, with all saving, and ever-delayed consumption.
  As Ant learns, the heart wants some music, too.

  ##### The Party's Over.

  As argued in , there are good reasons to believe that we are growing much slower than we could at greater savings, and that, already, we have taken out loans on the future.
  No matter what the heart wants, we may have to turn down the music quite a bit.

  ##### Deciding How Much To Consume.

  Correctly understood, the PCT is actually agnostic towards how much we, as a society, consume or save.

  What is missing in the description so far --- as it is in much of the politics of tax --- is what happens with the revenue.
  Taxation does not reduce resources, but (with a small DWL), merely redirects them.
  It is then up to the democratic state, or the individuals to which it redistributes, to decide how much should be saved or invested and how much should be devoted to consumption.

  ##### Deciding Who Consumes.

  Let us (optimistically) assume that the current savings rate is optimal, that aggregate consumption must remain on current levels, and that the public expenditure quota is optimal.
  Even in this (unlikely) scenario, the government can use the PCT as a pure redistributive tax to redirect resources from big spenders to small spenders, with no effect on the savings rate or public budgets.
  All government would have to do is to either zero-rate the small spenders (a de-facto redistribution *to* them), or hand out additional transfers to them.
  To go back to the car example, the PCT would redirect resources from buyers of BMWs to buyers of budget Dacia Logans.

  Alternatively, government itself can also spend the revenue on public goods or risk pools.
  For instance, government could organize a big parade or a fireworks display on the national holiday.
  The savings rate would be unaffected.
  The same amount of resources would be spent, just by a different body and for a different purpose.

  ##### S-Classes to Subways.

  Let us now consider what happens when the PCT is used to increase the savings rate, as described in the above.
  When implemented with an appropriately , the PCT *does not* lead to a drop in aggregate demand (page ).
  It merely redirects economic resources from the production of consumer goods to the production of capital goods.
  Under axiomatically assumed , factor markets always clear.
  That means that surplus incomes (savings) will always find profitable investment.

  This capital deepening of the economy can take many forms.
  In the public budget, it can mean building a new school, upgrading our infrastructure, funding basic research or abating and adapting to climate change.
  On the marketplace, it can mean building a new factory for solar panels, developing a new biotech patent or building more equity to guard against the next financial crisis.

  Whatever the use, in a perfect market, capital deepening is an unambiguously good thing.
  It means to enrich our world, with powerful
  factories, liberating technologies and empowering education.
  When people and institutions are given enough time to adapt to the new incentives, no welfare will be lost and no factors will sit idle.
  Mercedes Benz just needs some time to convert its production line from S-Class sedans to economic minivans, or even public transportation.

  #### The Foundational Beauty of the PCT.

  \phantomsection
  [\[sec:foundational-beauty\]]{#sec:foundational-beauty label="sec:foundational-beauty"}
  Gleaming behind its ability to make us all enrich our world, there is a greater normative appeal to the PCT:
  its beautiful alignment with a foundational theory of private property.

  By taxing consumption, the PCT leaves incentives to work *and* save unaffected.
  The PCT *is* as per desideratum [\[des:structural-agnosticism\]](#des:structural-agnosticism){reference-type="ref" reference="des:structural-agnosticism"}.
  Like the VAT, it taxes neither of them, but only the component of *all* income that is consumed.
  In contrast to the VAT, it does so without sacrificing progression.

  "Under the progressive consumption tax", as industrialist C.
  William Hazelett put it to the US Senate in 1939, "we define income at what it really is.
  There is no economic income but the living standard of the taxpayer" (Hazelett as cited in [@Bank2004 15].

  Consumption is the very transaction at which we take a part of the riches of our economy, exclude other people from its partaking and use it up.
  The PCT taxes you for *what you take out of the cake*, not for *what you contributed to the cake* [@Seidman1997 58].

  This foundational ideal of taxation goes back a long time.

  ##### The Difference Principle of Consumption Taxation.

  They probably did not know it then, but what already @Hobbes-1651-aa and @Smith-1776-lq saw in the progressive taxation of consumption was the ingenious conciliation of equity and efficiency in the modern world which we now call the @Rawls-1971ian and which here is listed in desideratum [\[des:difference-principle\]](#des:difference-principle){reference-type="ref" reference="des:difference-principle"}.
  The PCT leaves untouched *that* economic inequality in incomes, in incentives, and in entrepreneurship which, in a perfect market, pareto-grows the cake for everyone, including the least well-off, as the difference principle mandates.
  The PCT taxes, discourages, disallows *that* economic inequality, in excessive consumption and positional gain, which slices up the cake in exclusive, inequitable pieces, devours it, leaving only the shameful crumbs for the rest.

  ##### Private Property Isn't Theft. But Neither Is It God-Given.

  \phantomsection
  [\[sec:AntiEntitlement\]]{#sec:AntiEntitlement label="sec:AntiEntitlement"}
  A foundational understanding of private property and taxation is not without its discontents.
  If you believe, as Robert @Nozick1974 does, "that a person is entitled to those goods acquired in uncoerced exchanges with others" [-@Nozick1974 149], there is no good reason (if at all) to tax this *entitled* private property again when it is consumed.
  A comprehensive (de)appreciation of such hyperliberal *entitlement theory* is beyond the scope of this thesis, but a preliminary critique I must offer.

  Naturalizing whatever the allocative results the free market produces as inalienable private property is as ahistorical as it is uncritical.
  Just a cursory look in the history reveals that private property has not been around for a very long time.
  For a constructed entitlement, written and signed on a piece of paper to be powerful enough to guarantee inalienable access to whichever economic resource it concerned, one thing was needed above all:
  security.
  If you have to use a stick everytime you want to exercise your property rights, they are not much worth to begin with.
  In an insecure world, sticks and physical power mean everything, pieces of paper mean nothing.
  This @Hobbes-1651-aaian nightmare of violent anarchy, incidentally, was resolved by the state.
  How did the state and its prototypical racketeers do it?
  They extracted protection money from the people they protected from (or, equivalently, *threatened with*) violence and theft [@Tilly-1985-aa].
  As these racketeers enjoyed technological innovation (gunfire) and economies of scale in their protection of violence, they became larger until they morphed into the modern state.
  From that day on, their protection money was called a tax.

  That hyperliberalism insists on essentially entitled, private property, but now begrudges the polity and the modern state its revenue is, to say the least, ungrateful.

  Private property is not the antithesis to a potent polity.
  They are part and parcel.
  You cannot have the growth that empowers a polity without private property (for now).
  You cannot have private property without a polity either violent enough, or equitable enough to maintain these very entitlements.

  Taxation should treat private property accordingly.
  Not as theft, but as taxable.

  #### The Perfect Tax.

  > *"A progressive postpaid consumption tax emerges as the fairest and least arbitrary of all comprehensive tax systems, precisely because it chooses to make its decisions about the appropriate level of progressivity at the right time.
  > In doing so, it burdens some but not all uses of capital and its yield, and for normatively attractive reasons."*\
  > Edward J. @McCaffery2005 [812]

  Let me introduce you:
  the perfect tax.

  The duty that is both elegant, and fair.
  The regime that lets our economies grow, and have everyone partake in its fruits.
  The excise that reconciles efficiency with equity.
  The only tax that does not either discourage savings, or is regressive [@Seidman1997 2].
  The set of rules that raises the revenue for a potent polity, and, at the same time, curbs wasteful decadence.

  The Nuclear Option --- Wealth Tax {#sec:ScoreWT}
  ---------------------------------

  A wealth tax, or more accurately, an expropriation tax shares many of the advantages of the PCT.

  A wealth tax is superior to a PCT in its ability to disperse the ownership of means of production.
  When inequality is (page ), taxing *consumption* at whichever progressive rate may not suffice to dampen capital accumulation in the hands of very few.

  Three other, more hypothetical considerations speak for a wealth tax.

  First, if there were a macroeconomic crisis of Marxian
  underconsumption, a wealth tax would provide a powerful lever to redistribute resources (to other people or the state) and consume them.
  This is an unlikely scenario:
  Marx's gloomy predictions on the crisis of capitalism have not become reality, and, if anything, OECD economies save too little.
  This is also about a liquidity crunch, and in that respect, it might help, if through a highly discretionary lever, which is not so great.
  In fact, there is both a Marxist (capital accumulation) AND a Keynesian (liquidity crunch) argument for it.

  Second, if there were an inefficient misallocation of resources in an overproduction of private goods (cars) and an underproduction of public goods (levees against rising sea levels), concerted expropriation under a wealth tax could provide for public works revenue much faster than a PCT can.

  Third, if there were a sustained excess indebtedness in public budgets, well-organized and progressive expropriation may be the least inefficient and arbitrary of all evils.
  Sovereign defaults are prone to cause panics and ripple effects in the world economy, as recently evidenced by the Greek debt *crisis* (not default) in 2009.
  Inflating your way out of sovereign debt also has severe adverse effects.
  Rational actors will freeze up their capital in non-monetary assets (such as real estate, or even gold) and be excessively conservative about the future.

  Most importantly, both sovereign defaults and inflation burden natural persons arbitrarily:
  like a corporate tax, defaults and inflation have no well-determined, let alone progressive incidence.
  A wealth tax, for all its shortcomings, has both.

  #### Better Than Income Taxation.

  In contrast to sharply progressive taxation of capital incomes, a wealth tax still maintains (if not strengthens) as per desideratum [\[des:Incentives\]](#des:Incentives){reference-type="ref" reference="des:Incentives"}.
  Even if the taxman will expropriate a certain percentage of your net worth at the end of the year, you will still try to make as much profit with what you have.
  A wealth tax is neutral with regards to the risk aversion of investors.

  #### Property is Power.

  There is an equity argument for a wealth tax, too.
  It requires that we relax condition itm:MaximizeProfits and allow *homo economicus* to make irrational investment decisions.

  If owners of capital exercise *discretion* in their decisions, rather than fully rational (if sophisticated and privately informed) cost-benefit analyses, great wealth bestows great power.
  Such investors, in the classic definition of power, can make other people do something they would not otherwise (pareto-optimally) have done [@Geoff2002 8ff].
  A wealth tax gets at that accumulation of power.

  #### Redistributive Instrument of Last Resort.

  A wealth tax has immense normative and practical drawbacks.
  It is antithetical to capitalist entrepreneurship.
  It disallows market production decisions on those means of productions with are confiscated.

  Most fundamentally, a wealth tax is plagued by the dilemma of having to evaluate in violation of desideratum [\[des:liquid-assets\]](#des:liquid-assets){reference-type="ref" reference="des:liquid-assets"}.
  As a tax on capital, it has to either evaluate illiquid assets as a central planner, or let owners escape taxation and freeze up liquidity.
  Since expropriation is already a state intervention in the economy, it probably makes a certain amount of sense to rely on accrual-based taxation through a central planner.

  #### A Nuclear Option.

  The flaws of a wealth tax are by no means trivial.
  Taxation on realization will allow evasion and wreak havoc on liquidity.
  Taxation on accrual, as expropriation in general, will put the political process under inordinate pressure by private interest.
  The (partial) central planner may be contaminated by widespread clientelism, or incompetent to begin with.

  The Backup --- NIT {#sec:ScoreNIT}
  ------------------

  A negative income tax (NIT) can serve to for low-productivity labor by subsidizing the purchasing-power parity minimum living standard of these small earners, as per desideratum [\[des:low-price-floor\]](#des:low-price-floor){reference-type="ref" reference="des:low-price-floor"}.
  It does so more elegantly and with a smaller (desideratum [\[des:minimal-DWL\]](#des:minimal-DWL){reference-type="ref" reference="des:minimal-DWL"}) than minimum wages or combined wages.
  At any level of productivity or gross income, workers will still have (desideratum [\[des:Incentives\]](#des:Incentives){reference-type="ref" reference="des:Incentives"}) to earn more.
  Workers experience less moral hazard not to work, or to work less than they otherwise would.
  Free-riding firms will have a harder time cannibalizing non-subsidized employment.

  #### A Methadone Program for Structural Unemployment.

  A NIT may be a very effective treatment of structural unemployment in the short term.
  In the long term, only greater education and productivity alleviate the root cause of structural unemployment.
  Transferring resources, however elegantly and at whichever level only treats the symptoms, not the disease.
  As a discretionary stabilizer, a NIT can be a structural painkiller, disguising necessary pressures to adapt and reform.

  One Tax, and You'Re Done: As Close to a Beer Coaster Tax as it Gets {#sec:OneTax}
  ===================================================================

  The PCT emerges as the by far superior tax of all of the redistributive taxes scored in the above, both real and hypothetical.
  It can replace all other redistributive taxes, including the (ugly) backstops to income taxation, the corporate, estate and gift taxes.
  Administering the PCT together with any of the existing taxes in the above will at best create unnecessary complications, and at worst, unintended double taxation.

  Organizing redistribution through only *one* tax has tremendous advantages.
  It will reduce costs in the administration and cut red tape for economic activity.
  It will also greatly enhance the transparency of taxation.
  Once the PCT is thoroughly explained, well-designed and implemented, it can enlighten the politics of tax.
  Only if we all understand and know *how* we are taxed and on what, can we begin to have a deliberative debate on *how much* we ought to redistribute.

  #### One Tax Only, Plus Two.

  The PCT may need a supplemental wealth tax and NIT.
  Both of these taxes are very imperfect taxes.
  Metaphorically, they are like powerful antibiotics:
  very effective as a last resort, but at the cost of severe side effects.
  They should be prescribed with care, and only if absolutely needed.

  ##### Bringing in the Nuclear Option: Tax Wealth Only If Absolutely Needed.

  The PCT alone may be insufficient to broaden the distribution of capital, given the self-reinforcing and excessive dynamics of inequality today.
  Taxing only the consumed component may be inadequate to get at some riches [@Shaviro2004 106].
  For some people, no matter how progressively their newest sports car is taxed, they will spend only out of their interest, if not out of petty cash.

  If, and only to the extent that the overall distribution of *private property* is deemed unacceptable only for the reasons mentioned in the above, a wealth tax may be advisable.
  It should target exclusively that inequality of the very, very rich which cannot be adequately taxed on their consumption only.

  ##### Bringing in the Backup: NIT Only If Absolutely Needed.

  The PCT goes some way to lower the price floor of low-productivity labor.
  Very small spenders would be zero-rated in their consumption.
  In effect, these people would receive for free all public goods and risk pools they ever benefit from.
  The productivity of some people may be so low, that even no taxation at all does not make ends meet.

  If, and only to the extent that people cannot live off their equilibrium labor incomes with zero-rated consumption, government should subsidize such labor through a NIT.

  Implementing The Perfect Tax {#sec:Implementation}
  ============================

  A comprehensive suggestion for the implementation of the PCT is beyond the scope of this thesis and my competence.
  Much legal, administrative and design specification will be required to make the PCT real.

  I provide here some preliminary thoughts on implementing the PCT and its problems.

  Durables
  --------

  #### Depreciation, not Expensing.

  A simple addition to a PCT is that durable consumer goods should not be expensed, but depreciated over time.
  A desirable tax as per desideratum [\[des:minimal-DWL\]](#des:minimal-DWL){reference-type="ref" reference="des:minimal-DWL"} will leave , including those between more durable (and expensive) and less durable (less expensive) goods.
  A simple cash flow treatment (expensing) of durable goods would punish people for buying high-quality, presumably expensive durables.
  If you buy a set of new, high quality household appliances in one year, your consumption spikes, irrespective of how long you will use the devices.
  Under a progressive schedule, you would be better of buying cheaper appliances more often (smoother consumption), rather than more expensive appliances less often.
  To avoid such distortion, a PCT should depreciate durables over time.
  The "consumption" of a durable good would incur to your as they are depreciated every year.
  Depreciation schedules for durable goods are tested and readily available in most tax legislations.

  #### *Really* Durable Goods: Real Estate.

  Depreciation of durable goods becomes more thorny for goods that never substantially depreciate, or even *appreciate* in value, as for example owner-occupied real estate.
  There are three possibilities to tax owner-occupied housing, all of which have severe drawbacks.

  First, house owners could be taxed on the imputed rents of the real estate.
  House owners would be treated to tenants, as mandated by desideratum [\[des:minimal-DWL\]](#des:minimal-DWL){reference-type="ref" reference="des:minimal-DWL"}.
  Any appreciation or depreciation of the house would go untaxed just like any other financial investment.
  This would require that the state, in the absence of an equilibrium rent, approximates market rental rates.

  Second, house owners could be taxed on a depreciation schedule set by the government (taxation on accrual).
  This would substantially alter incentives to invest in owner-occupied housing.
  In a house that appreciates in *market* value, occupying owners would be at a relative disadvantage to non-occupying owners and their tenants.
  Much like taxation on accrual, depreciation requires the government to act as a central planner, albeit in a much smaller sector of the economy.
  Under a PCT, only owner-occupied housing, or owner-used durables may require government valuation, not *all* illiquid assets as under income or wealth taxation.

  Third, house owners could be taxed on the resale price of the house (taxation on realization).
  When a house looses market value, occupying-owners will be taxed on the difference in price.
  Owner-occupied housing that gains in market value would escape taxation.
  Much like taxation on realization, taxation on resale price will substantially alter the incentives in the economy, in violation of [\[des:minimal-DWL\]](#des:minimal-DWL){reference-type="ref" reference="des:minimal-DWL"}.
  Markets of depreciating owner-occupied housing may freeze up entirely, in fear of the impending tax burden.
  Markets of appreciating owner-occupied housing may overheat, with demand inflated by the tax-free consumption of such housing.
  Occupying owners would be treated starkly differently than non-occupying owners and their tenants.
  Occupying owners would be subjected to a bifurcated risk distribution.
  If their house gains in value, they go free entirely:
  they gain an income and receive tax-free consumption.
  If their house looses value, they get punished twice:
  they loose wealth and get taxed on the loss.

  On cursory inspection, the least arbitrary and disruptive method to tax owner-occupied housing or owner-used durables in general appear to be imputed rents.

  Introducing the PCT
  -------------------

  The transition to an exclusive, progressive taxation of consumption will require careful planning and specification.

  #### Go Slow.

  \phantomsection
  [\[sec:GoSlow\]]{#sec:GoSlow label="sec:GoSlow"}
  Most importantly, a transition to the PCT must be credible, but very slow.
  Moving to the PCT is probably more a process of (one to three) decades, than of years.
  The principal reason to transition very slowly is that the economy needs time to exit from the production of (positional) consumer goods to the production of investment goods and/or cheaper consumer goods.
  If incentives change faster than firms can cheaply exit and enter, welfare is lost [@Seidman1997 20].
  When Mercedes is forced to abandon the S-Class production line before it is depreciated or before it can be cheaply converted, we are just burning capital.

  It will probably be wise to phase in the PCT over several years.
  The PCT should be introduced on a binding timeline grandfathered-in at year one of the transition, to reliably incentivize firms to change their production.

  Additional problems not discussed here may stem from short- and medium term monetary dynamics.
  A careful investigation of monetary correlates of taxation and the introduction of a PCT in particular must (page ).

  #### Intergenerational Incidence.

  \phantomsection
  [\[sec:IntergenerationalIncidence\]]{#sec:IntergenerationalIncidence label="sec:IntergenerationalIncidence"}
  A tax reform as paradigmatic as from income to consumption will affect people differently depending on when in their lifetime income and consumption streams the reform sets in [@Graetz2009 1649].
  People with savings, absent other specification, will be taxed three times on these savings:
  once when they were initially earned, a second time when they earned an interest (), and a third time when they spend it under the newly introduced PCT.
  People with no savings, absent other specification, will be taxed only once.

  Savings and income follow a probabilistic lifecycle:
  people save out of their income in their middle years to spend when they are old and have no income.
  [^21]
  When the PCT is introduced, people who are old at the time of introduction will contribute more to the polity over their lifetime than people who are young at the time of introduction.

  To a certain extent, intergenerational redistribution of this scope may well be the unavoidable side product of a changing society.
  Equity considerations may come to an end just here:
  you are not entitled to recompensation for *when* in the history of a society you are born.
  Still, the magnitude of triple taxation of old people may be so immense that a PCT should address the intergenerational incidence caused at the time of introduction.

  Investment vs. Consumption
  --------------------------

  #### Deductions.

  The PCT requires a white list for cash uses that qualify as saving.
  For many financial products, the distinction will be straightforward:
  whenever means of production are acquired (equity) or financed (debt), whether as mutual funds, bonds, stocks or life insurance, the respective payments will be deducted from income and dissavings (, page ).

  ##### Education.

  For some cash uses, the distinction may be more complicated.
  Education is a good example.
  On the one hand, *some* component of some education constitutes saving into one's own human capital, one's own means of production.
  On the other hand, education can (and should!) also serve other purposes of self-realization, fulfillment and leisure.
  A summer school in the fine arts is something that we may want many people to enjoy, but it is not in any strict sense an investment.
  Ideally, it should be taxed as consumption.

  These and other lines will be hard to draw in practice.
  Given the broadly beneficial and various spillover effects of education (maybe the fine arts *do* inspire you, after all), it will probably be wiser to err on the side of too much deductable education, rather than too little [@Seidman1997 8].

  #### Self-Employment.

  The line between consumption and investment gets even more blurry, when people own their own means of production other than their human capital.

  First, the distinction between self-employed people and employees should be resurrected.
  When people *do not* bear the full financial risk of their economic activity, their expenses other than education *should not* be deductible.
  Both the commute to work (Pendlerpauschale, commuter tax allowance) and the costs of securing a job (Werbungskosten, income-related expenses), in a perfect market, should be reimbursed in equilibrium incomes, not through tax breaks.

  Second, when people *are* their own risk-takers, all their expenses *should* be deductible.
  Unincorporated, self-employed people must have a tax burden fully equivalent to that of incorporated firms.
  Under a PCT regime, both should not pay any redistributive or general revenue taxes.

  The private consumption unrelated to the business activity of self-employed people should be tax liable.
  In real life, this line will be very blurry:
  which percentage of a large sedan or business attire is required for the job, and which percentage for private use?

  Specifying these rules and regulations for the tax liability of self-employed people (and unincorporated firms) will be very tedious.
  Still, a necessarily unelegant, but rough approximation of what is private and what is business expense should be possible.

  #### Fringe Benefits.

  An equivalent problem occurs when incorporated firms hand out non-cash benefits to employees (or owners).
  These non-cash benefits, while never formally detected as a cash flow under , may constitute additional non-cash income.
  Without further specification of the PCT, such fringe benefits would escape taxation entirely:
  private consumption of the (luxurious, gas-guzzling) company car would go untaxed.

  To avoid untaxed fringe benefits, the taxman has to audit the books of corporations to detect and quantify non-cash Benefits
  [^22]
  .
  Employees who receive non-cash benefits would be tax liable on the cash equivalent of these benefits as incomes.
  All other things equal, if they do not offset their company car use by additional saving, they will be taxed on its consumption.

  Gifts and Bequests
  ------------------

  Gifting and bequesting will not be taxed.
  It is an accrual to (or loss of) wealth (income), but does not constitute consumption.
  Instead, gifted resources will be taxed when *recipients* consume them out of their respective (page ).

  When non-cash resources are gifted, donor and donee have to agree on an evaluation of the gift.
  Donors and donees will have opposing incentives to evaluate the gift.

  Donors will have an incentive to overstate the value of their gift:
  the more inflated the value, the smaller their income, the smaller their taxable consumption.
  If real income drops less than the gift-inflated reported income, people can dissave and spend the difference tax free.

  Donees will have an incentive to understate the value of their gift:
  the more deflated the value, the smaller their income, the smaller their taxable consumption.
  If real income increases more than the gift-inflated reported income, people can dissave and spend the difference tax free.

  Ideally, donor and donee will agree on and report an evaluation close to the equilibrium price of the gift as a result of their opposing incentives.
  [^23]

  Imputed Income
  --------------

  People can consume their own income without either the income or the consumption ever showing up in a cash flow.
  This occurs when people iron their own clothes, or when they sit idle and enjoy their free time.
  Both self-supply and leisure would go untaxed under a pure PCT.
  People would be incentivized to iron their own clothes, rather than have someone else do it for a cash flow detected price.
  Likewise, people would be incentivized to enjoy their leisure, rather than enjoy some additional good or service they could have earned in the same time.

  This is undesirable for two reasons.
  First, it pre-tax market prices in an arbitrary way, in violation of desideratum [\[des:minimal-DWL\]](#des:minimal-DWL){reference-type="ref" reference="des:minimal-DWL"}.
  Ironing your clothes yourself or giving them to a dry cleaning should not be taxed differently.
  Second, it favors autarky over welfare-improving trade.
  When cash-based division of labor is disincentivized, many absolute and comparative advantages may be foregone.
  The dry cleaner may be much more efficient, or at least relatively more efficient in ironing your clothes.

  This problem can be solved by including an imputed income in the cash flow for everyone.
  If you earn no income at all and spend nothing at all, the assumption would be that you consume your own work entirely.
  If you are living the autarky lifestyle, you cannot offset your imputed income with any savings.
  All of your imputed income is, by definition, consumed, and taxable.
  If you are living the separation-of-labor lifestyle, you receive an actual income on top of your imputed income.
  You can spend your actual income and save out of your imputed income.
  At (presumably) equal living standards, only one of the two incomes is consumed, and taxed.
  The PCT with an imputed income is neutral towards the relative configurations of leisure, self-supplying consumption and cash-compensated separation of labor.

  An imputed income also serves as an elegant backstop to barter transactions undertaken to evade the PCT.

  #### Strengthening Comparative Advantage.

  The theory of comparative advantage dictates that one should specialize in whichever production one is *relatively* more efficient [@Ricardo1817].
  Even if a doctor can iron her shirts faster than the worker at the dry cleaning, she should outsource ironing because she is relatively even more productive at providing medical care, compared to the worker with no medical training.
  Efficient incentives should reflect the comparative advantage of the doctor in providing medical care.
  Under the PCT, even with a flat imputed income, this is not the case.

  All other things equal, a highly productive doctor has an *equal* tax incentive to send her laundry to the dry cleaning as, say, a social science PhD student with questionable productivity.
  When they do their own ironing, both are taxed on the *same*, flat imputed income that they are consuming in supplying themselves.
  In reality, the two have very different opportunity costs in ironing:
  doing another brain surgery, or spending another afternoon on the internet.
  Ideally, the doctor should be incentivized to outsource much *more* at *same* levels of consumption than the PhD student.

  A variable, imputed income based on past earnings accomplishes just that.
  If you have shown to be very productive, you will be incentivized to devote your time to that highly productive and well-paid activity.
  If the doctor irons her own shirt, she consumes out of a much higher imputed income on which she will be taxed.
  If she instead gives the shirts to the dry cleaning and does another brain surgery in the meantime, given *same* levels of consumption, she will be taxed only on the presumably lower price paid in cash at the dry cleaning.

  It is important to note that including even a variable, imputed income based on past earnings *does not* force more productive people to work more.
  At *same* levels of consumption, it merely incentivizes them to work whichever time they choose to work at whatever they are best at.

  An imputed income based on past earnings also does not force highly productive people to adopt any *specific* combination of work and leisure.
  It merely incentivizes them to adopt the *same* combination as other people.
  Absent a dynamic, imputed income, very productive people could maintain the same standards of living (consumption) with much less work than less productive people.

  Still, to incentivize productive work, an imputed income based on past earnings must not entirely reflect higher productivities.
  If higher productivity does not allow you to *either* work less *or* consume more, you may never strive too hard in the first place.

  Cross-Border Transactions {#sec:IntlPCT}
  -------------------------

  As with any tax, additional complications arise when cross-border transactions are concerned.

  The problems arising from *different* tax rates or tax regimes between countries are not addressed here.
  The real existing international political economy of taxation is what is *malleable*, or what demands *explanation* given the doable and desirable hypothetical established here.

  #### The End Game.

  First assume that all developed countries have transitioned to the PCT.
  All income, value-added, corporate and withholding taxes are abolished.
  People would be taxed based on residence [@Graetz2009 1645].
  [^24]

  Consumption abroad would be liable to taxation at home.
  Investment abroad, when properly documented, would qualify for tax deductions.
  If in doubt, the taxman can simply assume that cash flows to another country constitute consumption until otherwise proven.
  Conversely, aliens consuming in another country would be taxed in their home country of residence.

  #### The Real World.

  In the real world, international transition to and harmonization of the PCT is likely to occur slowly, if ever.
  In the meantime, introducing the PCT will create some problems and complexities.

  Citizens investing or consuming abroad can be taxed on their global consumption at home.
  Receipts for VATs, income or withholding taxes paid abroad can be deducted from their PCT liability.

  Taxing consumption abroad may violate WTO regulations on the free movement of goods, services and capital.

  People can evade the PCT if they cash in foreign capital and labor incomes abroad and consume it there.
  Considerable international tax cooperation will be necessary to avoid such evasion.
  Non-PCT countries may have few incentives to cooperate.

  Foreign residents earning labor or capital incomes at home, absent any PCT account for them, would still have to be income taxed.
  Similarly, to maintain stable revenues, government would have to retain withholding taxes on foreign-owned corporations.
  [^25]
  This will create considerable administrative duplications and contradictions.

  Family
  ------

  Notwithstanding in accordance with desideratum [\[des:personal-taxation\]](#des:personal-taxation){reference-type="ref" reference="des:personal-taxation"}, people who share living quarters and pool resources should be taxed as one household, as argued in .
  Under a progressive schedule and with no, or only a small penalty to mechanical solidarity in marriage or other forms of intimate cohabitation, the tax liability of such units will depend on the distribution of consumption (not income) in a household.
  A big spender marrying a small spender will enjoy a much greater benefit than two small spenders.

  Aside from spouses, children are often dependents relying on mechanical solidarity.
  Under the pure PCT, they are treated equivalently.
  Their income and saving is added up to a household-wide , consumption is then divided by the number of persons in that household and taxed at the respective rate of *average* consumption in the family.
  While this will already give parents a tax break, it is not clear that the relief would be sufficient or appropriately distributed.

  #### Why Averaging May Not Suffice: Children Are Investments.

  Averaging taxable consumption alone will treat a child exactly like a spouse.
  Considering the low fertility rates in many developed countries and the severe dissaving of an aging (not shrinking!) population, this equal treatment may be insufficient.
  Rearing a child is fulfilling, but it is also a costly investment into the future of your society.

  Averaging taxable consumption alone will give limited financial incentive to procreate.
  I cannot address here whether such pro-natalist policy would be normatively desirable, or even effective.
  Either way, the polity should be *able* to incentivize child rearing, if it so sees fit.

  #### Why Averaging Only May be Undesirable: Tax Breaks Favor the Big Spenders.

  Again, as in marriage, the value of the tax break depends on the distribution of consumption within the family.
  The starker the differences, the greater the benefit.
  Assume that children require relatively less consumption than adults, and are less prone to excessive consumption on their behalf:
  compared to the very big spenders on cars, yachts and houses, even a designer-clad toddler is relatively cheap.
  It follows that those very big spenders, taxed at higher rates will benefit the most from averaging their consumption with that of their (truly) smaller spender children.
  It is hard to defend normatively why of all potential parents the big spender should reap the greatest fiscal benefit for rearing a child.

  #### Add to the PCT: An Allowable Deduction for Children.

  Both of these shortcomings can be addressed by supplementing the PCT with an allowable deduction for children.
  Such a flat deduction would treat consumption on behalf of a child up to a certain amount as an investment into the future.
  It would be fully tax deductible.
  This could be accomplished by simply adding a fixed amount of annual saving for every dependent child to that household's Haig-Simons equation.
  An allowable deduction for children would create an extra incentive *independent* of the level of spending of the parents, so as long as they consume anything
  [^26]
  .

  The Formula for the PCT
  -----------------------

  Specifying the schedule and formulae for the PCT will require extensive econometric and fiscal research, as well as frequent adjustments during its introduction.
  I can only list the terms of the formulae here, and suggest some tentative criteria for each of the terms.

  #### Taxable Consumption in Real, not Nominal Terms.

  Taxable consumption is given by the (page ), with the addition of gifts and bequests made and received, imputed income and an allowable deduction for children.
  Taxable consumption is then averaged over the entire household.
  Taxable consumption should not be in nominal values for two reasons.

  First, nominal consumption would be subjected to inflation.
  If the schedule is constant, people pay ever more taxes by a dynamic called *cold progression*
  [^27]
  .

  Second, economies grow.
  As our economies get richer and richer, consumption should grow, too.
  Notwithstanding the need for a higher savings quota, there is no reason to tax consumption in absolute terms for all time.
  Rather, consumption should be taxed progressively in relation to overall production, or the size of the cake.

  For these reasons, taxable consumption should be denominated *relative* to a multi-year running average of GDP.
  [^28]

  #### Progressive Schedule.

  The progressive schedule, while open to a great deal of political discretion must satisfy the following conditions.

  ##### Sufficient Revenue.

  To be revenue neutral, or to raise more revenue for underprovided public goods and risk pools, the rates must be sufficiently high and sufficiently steep.
  Because discrete price elasticities of demand in positional or excessive consumption are unknown, revenues for any given schedule are hard to project without further econometric research.
  The schedule will likely require careful adjustment as it is introduced and actual price elasticities are observed.

  ##### Savings Rate.

  The schedule must be sufficiently steep to incentivize the democratically elected savings rate, taking into account real dissavings.
  Again, it is hard to project savings behavior for any given schedule without further econometric research or implementation in the real world.

  ##### Generational Incidence.

  To alleviate the triple taxation of old savers upon the introduction of the PCT, the schedule could be allowed to vary for people of different age.
  A term expressing the percentage of life expectancy lived under income taxation could be included in the formula to discount the tax burden for older savers.

  ##### Entry Bracket.

  The lowest bracket will be particularly hard to determine in width and rate.
  [^29]
  On the one hand, it must be sufficiently wide and sufficiently low rated to minimize the as per desideratum [\[des:low-price-floor\]](#des:low-price-floor){reference-type="ref" reference="des:low-price-floor"}.
  On the other hand, an entry bracket too wide in scope and too low in rate may allow too many small-spending people to free ride on the public goods and risk pools financed by everyone else.

  #### Design.

  For the PCT to garner popular support and to work its magic, intelligent design is key.

  ##### Fully Automatic.

  Both to enable instant marginal rates and to reduce administrative cost, the PCT liabilities should be calculated with minimal human discretion, and invoiced fully electronically.
  Since cash flows are already recorded at financial institutions it probably makes sense to interface them directly with tax administration and have them withdraw tax liabilities on a regular basis.
  Given modern information technology and enough time for careful development, an ideal PCT should work without people ever handing in a tax return or many other (paper) forms of any kind.
  The tax administration will establish which cash flow recipients qualify as investment.
  Citizens will indicate cash flows that are donations or gifts.
  All other cash outflows will be treated as consumption.
  Whenever consumers buy an officially recognized durable good, the respective price will accrue to their consumption over time according to a fixed depreciation schedule.
  Lists of durable goods and respective depreciation schedules already exist in developed tax administration.
  Whenever consumers buy owner-occupied housing (or some other extremely durable, owner-used good), they are charged with the imputed rental rate.
  Tax administrations would have to establish electronic lists with fair market rental rates for such goods.

  ##### Instant Marginal Rates.

  PCT liabilities must be invoiced much more often than income taxes.
  People cannot wait until the end of the year until they know how much consumption tax they paid on the last present they bought for Christmas.
  For the PCT to be transparent, and to reliably signal people against positional consumption, people need to know in real time their marginal rate of progressive consumption taxation at *every* possible consumption decision.
  Because the PCT is personally progressive the listed gross prices of goods in the store will have little resemblence to the net prices incurred to individual taxpayers.
  One apple does not have the same VAT rate for everyone, but it may have a tax rate of zero for one small-spending person, and a tax rate of 800% for the big spender next in line at the grocery store.
  [^30]
  Modern ICT (think mobile devices) should enable intelligent designs to inform people about their current marginal tax rate.

  ##### Running Averages.

  Annual invoicing of the PCT also makes little sense because that would cause lower PCT rates for everyone in January than in December of each year.
  At the other extreme, it also makes little sense to tax people for their consumption every day, or even every month.
  Not only would consumption be cheaper in the morning than in the evening, people would also be punished excessively for unavoidable, short-term spikes in their consumption.
  Under daily taxation, buying a suit on one day would be taxed at a higher rate, than buying the jacket and pants on different days.
  Under monthly taxation, a long summer vacation would be taxed at a higher rate than monthly weekend trips.
  This makes little sense because it violates the (page ).
  People must be able to shift consumption freely to some extent.
  In the real world, people probably also receive utility from a long summer vacation for a longer time than just the duration (let alone the infinitesimally short expensing) of the trip.
  Summer vacations, suits and other consumables cannot be practically depreciated.

  Instead, people should be taxed on running averages of their consumption over extended periods of time.
  At minimum, an annual, moving average of consumption will be required for meaningful and practical taxation of consumption.
  A lifetime average consumption, with significant discounting of long past consumption may also be worth consideration.

  Not All Progressive Consumption Taxes are Created Equal. {#sec:PCTTwins}
  ========================================================

  > *"The real and pressingly practical question for tax is not whether to have an income or a consumption tax, but what form of consumption tax to have.
  > The stakes in this battle are clear and dramatic:

  > --- Edward J. @McCaffery2005 [817]

  The PCT has been considered and suggested many times in recent history.
  It was considered after World War I as a *graduated spendings tax* [@Bank2004 2], again in 1942 by Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau under the label of *graduated surtax on spending* and, most recently, in 1995 by Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA), Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Bob Kerrey (D-NE) as the Unlimited Savings Allowance (USA Tax).

  It is important to note that not all these, nor current proposals are created equal.
  They differ in important details from the PCT proposal suggested here.

  First, many PCT proposals, including the 1995 USA tax do not include dissavings in their definitions [@Bank2004 18].
  A PCT that exempts consumption out of debt or savings, leaves a colossal share of excessive consumption untouched.
  Such a PCT is very limited in its progression.

  Second, many PCT proposals are not radical enough in their departure from an income tax regime.
  They keep some of the old clutter and cause debilitating interactions and complications.
  The USA tax, for example, did not terminate the estate and gift taxes, even though these are *transfers of wealth*, not new consumption [@Bank2004 19].
  The resulting administrative complication (evaluation of illiquid goods) and necessary deductions to avoid double taxation of spent gifts and bequests made it an incoherent nightmare.
  [^32]

  #### The PCT's Evil Neocon Twin.

  A particularly brazen disfigurement of the ideal of progressive consumption taxation comes from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), which sponsors and [markets](http://www.aei.org/outlook/29082) the *@Bradford X-tax* as a progressive consumption tax [@Bradford].
  The @Bradford1986 X-Tax is a two-tiered tax originally suggested in [-@Bradford1986].
  It comprises of a flat, European-style VAT with deductions for all wages, and a progressive wage tax.
  Why anyone would use the term "progressive consumption tax" to describe the Bradford X-Tax is hard to explain, except for sinister intent to create confusion.
  [^33]

  The Least Imperfect Tax {#sec:LeastImperfect}
  =======================

  Borrowing Churchill's classic adage, the PCT may not be the perfect tax, but for all the alternative taxes we know.
  It has two fundamental shortcomings.

  Work/Play, A Constructed and Diffuse Border On Which Taxation Depends {#sec:work-play}
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  The fundamental problem in bringing the PCT to the real world is that it depends on a very clear distinction between investment and consumption.
  The problem is:
  this "notion of a sharp division between pleasure-seeking and profit-seeking is alien to human psychology and essentially unrealistic" [@Bittker1973 203].
  Just like (page ) in (page ) the PCT depends on a distinction that does not unambiguously exist in the lives of people.
  
  
  %this is the big-ass homo-economicus question.
  %Include a somewhat extensive discussion, include extensive references, argue why tax (materialism) still matters.

  Where PCT administration defines and enforces this boundary anyway, severe distortions, evasion and administrative complications necessarily ensue.
  The problem of identifying fringe benefits already exists under the income tax [@Graetz2009 1591], and they will become more severe as incentives for tax-free, excessive consumption increase.

  There is no easy or elegant fix to this.
  Tax administrations cannot fairly and simply establish whether an AC at the office, an extravagant business lunch or an executive MBA in an exotic location is an investment, or consumption.
  It is probably both, to some extent.

  These gazillions of loopholes for tax evasion cannot be elegantly closed, by one strike of tax administration genius.
  Instead, the PCT will require tax administrations to plug each and every one of them at a time, all the while not stifling economic activity and maintaining some degree of fairness.

  It appears that whenever government wants to tax progressively, it is, to varying degree forced into the role of central planner and micromanager of inequality.
  The PCT may just offer the least severe of these administrative nightmares, or at least, no worse than the nightmare of progressive income taxation [@Graetz2009 1595].

  Stratification, Elsewhere.
  --------------------------

  Notwithstanding its grandiose ambition to curtail positional consumption, the PCT will not do away with all harmful stratification in the modern world.
  People may simply find other avenues for the very same, very dysfunctional positional games.
  Straightforwardly, people can show off their wealth by displaying slowly depreciating durables, or even jewelry.
  Even when these are taxed on imputed rents, people can still play status games in all our immaterial dimensions of difference.
  With no notice to the taxman or your democratic polity, you can break *The Spirit Level* [@Pickett-2009-kx] through cultural distinction [@Bourdieu-1984-aa], romantic and sexual relationships [@Mazur-1993-aa] or anything else that makes us not only different, but also unequal.

  This is not so much a shortcoming of the PCT as it is the end of democratic, liberal policy.
  Whenever policy moves beyond material leveling, by prescribing habitus, or even whom people meet and mate, it risks poisoning the polity with totalitarian zeal.

  An Angel in Tax
  ---------------

  > *"I will not add fuel to think tank fires.
  > Complexity can wait.
  > The devil may indeed dwell in the details, but we first need to find an angel or two in the abstractions that govern tax."*\
  > --- Edward J. @McCaffery2002 [6f.]

  The limitations and problems of the PCT notwithstanding, it *is* the least imperfect tax.
  In the abstractions even more than in its implementation, these angels point to the PCT.

  [^1]: In Germany, earnings after interest, depreciation and amortization.

  [^2]: When a corporation hands out a dividend, the dividend is also [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"}ed.
      In some jurisdictions, [cit]{acronym-label="cit" acronym-form="singular+short"} is deductible from the [pit]{acronym-label="pit" acronym-form="singular+short"} on dividends.
      No taxation of dividends applies when the recipient is another corporation.

  [^3]: Payments into capital-based pension schemes are not straightforwardly taxes.
      Government may however choose to mandate or subsidize such payments to increase the savings rate.

  [^4]: Still, the VAT is prone to tax fraud.
      Organized crime gangs can extract money from governments by a strategy of *missing trader fraud*:
      Fraudulent importers buy zero-rated export goods from exporters in other jurisdictions to sell them with VAT to domestic buyers.
      The importing company then absconds (goes bankrupt) without forwarding the VAT to the government.
      Because domestic buyers are eligible for refunds of VAT if they add value to the good, the embezzled VAT by the fraudulent importer incurs loss to government.
      In *carousel fraud*, or, most recently *contra-trading* schemes, a greater number of conspiring firms pass around goods in circles to avoid detection of the original tax fraud.

  [^5]: Greater detail is provided in on the and are discussed in .

  [^6]: The analogy, which I take from [@McCaffery2005], is somewhat amiss, for the original Grasshopper does not earn much, but sings.

  [^7]: In the real world, payroll taxes are levied only on employees, and not on self-employed people.
      That practice *does* change relative prices of employed and self-employed work.
      Analytically, this discrimination is an aberration from a perfect payroll tax.
      In principle, self-employed people should be liable for a payroll tax on the wages they pay themselves.

  [^8]: Social insurance contributions as a selective payroll tax on capped labor incomes *do not* fall on all natural persons, but only some.
      Again, an ideal payroll tax would burden everyone.

  [^9]: This is *not* some kind of welfare-mother argument.
      It is not that lazy people cause structural unemployment and free-ride on the polity.
      Rather, the polity makes it systematically impossible for some of its members to participate gainfully in the economy.

  [^10]: Only a PCT, by virtue of its progressive schedule, will as argued in .

  [^11]: I take these lessons in "tax planning 101" --- only slightly tongue in cheek --- from @McCaffery2005's seminal piece on *A New Understanding of Tax* [-@McCaffery2005 888ff].

  [^12]: Recall that to have a capital income one first has to have a surplus of unconsumed labor income.

  [^13]: Sometimes, at the margin of local decisions public goods also become common goods or natural monopolies:
      that extra motorway feeder may be necessary only for a small number of logistically intensive firms (rival consumption) and local government may well negotiate with the interested firms on whether to build the road or not (exclusion).

  [^14]: This of course depends on a very gentle phasing in of the tax so as to allow producers to cheaply exit their production of excessive consumer goods, and cheaply enter another market.
      This requirement for the of the PCT is further discussed in .

  [^15]: ...even though few people will deny that much of autobahn gratification stems from overtaking other cars, if not people.

  [^16]: BMW's claim, *Freude am Fahren*.

  [^17]: In the extreme, government can even make the PCT a variable, progressive subsidy to low-income earners to spend.
      The PCT would then have a negative rate at the very bottom of the schedule:
      government would reward the first units of consumption with a small subsidy once the transaction is done (postpaid).
      Windfall effects would be minimal as people cannot direct the subsidy into further saving.

  [^18]: Who knows?
      --- Had they known about , and had they foreseen the coming wonders of electronic retail banking, they might have saved us all a lot of trouble.

  [^19]: For starters, desiderata are not (yet) comprehensively exhaustive and mutually exclusive (MECE).
      They are also not weighted.

  [^20]: A fully-fledged CBA would require ordinal, if not cardinal quantification of equity and efficiency.
      Quantifying the gains of the suggested superior tax choice, if possible at all, will be key to the further development of this project.
      For this, and other see further .

  [^21]: Whether this saving is implemented as a PAYGO, capital-based or entirely private scheme is of no relevance to the question of intergenerational incidence.

  [^22]: Note that this is the *only* reason under the PCT for the taxman to check the bookkeeping of incorporated firms.

  [^23]: When the progressive rates of donor and donee are very different, incentives will not be strictly symmetrically opposed.
      A big-spender donor has a greater incentive to inflate, than a small-spender donee has an incentive to deflate.
      Slightly false reporting of prices of gifts and some tax evasion may ensue.
      Where gifts and bequests are substantial and differences in progressive rates great, government may have to intervene and correct evaluations.

  [^24]: The residence principle in taxation is problematic when people frequently and for longer periods of time change their primary residence.
      If you live, spend and work "abroad", you depend on public goods (fire service), risk pools (disaster relief) and redistribution (social peace) in that country.
      In effect, you become part of that polity, no matter the citizenship regime or your legal status as resident alien.
      The residence principle in taxation is fundamentally at odds with a cosmopolitan lifestyle.

      Input and output congruency demand that whoever partakes in a polity pays, and votes in it, too [@Zurn-2000-aa].
      Progressive, of consumption demands that people pay for what they spend, irrespective of where they spend it.
      Even without international tax competition and evasion, these two norms can be reconciled only when all developed countries adopt the same progressive schedule, and the same base for taxation.

      The cosmopolitan contradictions to the residence principle are not germane to taxation.
      They are the principle condition a denationalized world, with no greater functional polity filling the void of the modern nation state.

      Taxation, like other policy areas, cannot respond to this change in itself.
      Without a greater polity, there will be no resolution to the contradictions of residence taxation.

  [^25]: For a different suggestion to transition to the PCT without corporate income taxation of foreign-owned firms, see .

  [^26]: With the addition of imputed income, all people consume something.
      The allowable deduction for children could, for example (partly) offset the costs of child care, whether done by a parent at home, or in daycare.

  [^27]: Again, the monetary dynamics of taxation cannot be addressed here.
      In income taxation, cold progression serves to dampen second-round effects of inflation.

  [^28]: Denominating taxable consumption relative to annual GDP would make the PCT procyclical.
      Short-term deviations from the long-term growth path should not matter.

  [^29]: The lowest, entry bracket of the PCT is the functional equivalent to the VAT.

  [^30]: This example makes obvious a seeming possibility for tax evasion:
      the big spender could give some cash to the small spender and have the small spender buy the apple on behalf of the big spender, at a much lower rate.

      The PCT should be relatively immune to this kind of tax evasion.
      Once the big spender has given her cash to the small spender, the small spender has no incentive, let alone legal obligation to buy the apple.
      The small spender can just keep the cash.

      The only way for the big spender to avoid consumption taxation on the price of the apple was to misreport her transaction to the small spender as a gift.
      It is then officially documented that the transaction was a gift, which, by legal definition carries no strings attached.
      The only option for the big spender to force the small spender to actually buy the apple is to report herself to the authorities for tax fraud and to declare the transaction as a taxable service ("buy me that apple"), not a gift.

      Given these incentives, the tax evasion deal is unlikely to ever occur.

  [^31]: For an extensive review of the history of progressive taxation of consumption, and the USA Tax in particular see @Seidman1997 [11ff]

  [^32]: The gift and estate tax were necessary under the disfigured USA tax because it had ignored dissavings.
      When consumption out of dissaving goes untaxed, tax evasion 101 ("buy, borrow, die") is operative.
      To get at least at some of the inherited and gifted wealth, the ugly backstops of income taxation (estate and gift tax) were kept.

  [^33]: [@Shaviro2004] delivers a particularly revealing example of conspicuous misrepresentation of the abstractions of tax and equity.
      At various points in his advocacy (desecration, really) of the "progressive consumption tax" (the Bradford X-Tax), he describes power, social standing or security through money as an instance of *money illusion* [-@Shaviro2004 106], argues that capital income is a meaningless category on the merits of a thought experiment in which a talented cook buys a restaurant and makes a fortune [-@Shaviro2004 100] and insists that infra-marginal returns are much like labor incomes because "one has only so much time and so many good ideas" [-@Shaviro2004 103].
